# 100   Stoicism

### Stoicism <a href="#_qgy23ecx44md" id="_qgy23ecx44md"></a>

Founded by Zeno of Elea and followed up by Chrysippus

#### Comparison with Epicureans <a href="#_g1fkhs6chpbv" id="_g1fkhs6chpbv"></a>

* Materialists, but not atomists, bodies are a continuous substances held together by tension
* Corporeal god, but at work in the world
* A Heraclitean cosmos, periodically consumed in fire
* Eternal recurrence: an infinite sequence of worlds
* Instead of _Ataraxia_ they believed in a “good flow of life” (not being distressed with what happens)
* Both agree we should not worry about what we can’t control but epicureans believe some outcomes are in our control, stoics that none is.

**Monism - God**

The Stoic god **is divine reason pervading the cosmos**, it’s a complex interconnected system like the parts of a natural organism, it is the soul of the cosmos (**like the world’s soul** of Plato's Timaeus)

They differentiate between **the active principle, LOGOS** **and the passive principle, matter**. The active being god.

For stoics the human reason is literally a portion of the dive LOGOS that animates the universe.

They believe the world is in a providential order, following the perfect plan of its governing deity, (not an anthropomorphic god). Everything is organized for the sake of humans whose **purpose is to align our reason with nature** (the divine reason).

Stoics believe plants have growth, animals' souls which gives them impulse (goal directed behavior) and humans reason (like Aristotle's) and that the point of humans having reason is that this allows us to control the impulses.

**Materialism**

For the stoics everything, including wisdom, justice, etc., are corporeal

**Impressions**

<**Music**> --i_mpression_→<**Ears**> --_rationalization → input_

We have no control over the impression a thing makes on us, but we can control the rationalization (how we react) of it.

#### In our control <a href="#_dohnw2388o2f" id="_dohnw2388o2f"></a>

Since the world is deterministic we can’t change it, **we can only change that which is in our control**.

Like trying to change the result of **2 + 2, it will always be 4, thinking otherwise it’s irrational.** The same can apply to not wanting to be sick or to not die.

Therefore **people who think they are in control are more miserable**

This could seem a world view proper of a slave, but it was taken both by Epictetus, a slave, and Marcus Aurelius, one of the most powerful men in history.

We are in control of what we do, but we are not in control of what will actually happen, this is up to god.

**Based on this view, if bad things happen, even if one does everything right, we need to understand and accept this as part of the divine plan and in this way we are aligning ourselves with nature.**

**Getting attached to things that I can’t control could cause pain**, we need to be aware we are making that decision, like adopting a puppy or having friends. These things have benefits but we risk to suffer (we know we will) when it’s gone.

If you want to get _X_, you need to do _Y._ Accept this relation, if someone does _Y_ and gets _X_ and you don’t do _Y_ don’t be jealous of them but accept they paid the price for that.

_**"Seek not to have things turn out as you wish, but rather wish for everything to happen as it does, and then your life will flow smoothly"**_ - Epictetus

This is called **the stoic attitude,** _caring only about the action but not about the goal_.

In order **to find pleasure in life we need to make the things we have to do enjoyable.**

Like studying or working out, we must find a way to make them fun and our life will be pleasurable

#### Fate <a href="#_2dc5fqgwxggj" id="_2dc5fqgwxggj"></a>

For stoics life is an interconnection of causes, **everything that happens in the universe is determined by this causal nexus**.

This is criticized with what is known as the lazy argument, basically no matter what I do the outcome is the same, so why not do nothing at all.

Stoics reply to this by saying that since everything is causal it is fated that you will also do the work, for example if fated to get a 10 in a test, then it’s also fated one will study and also go to the exam, this call co-fated.\
The key is that **for stoics there's no way of knowing which effort will make a difference.**

It’s important to understand that stoic **fate is not fatalistic**, which means no matter what I do I will fail or the typical Greek myth.

**Perfect and Auxiliary causes**

Another critic to this argument is that if all actions are fated then no actions are up to us (which is against stoic belief). This was “countered” by explaining that there are _**perfect & principal causes**_ and _**auxiliary & proximate causes.**_

For example, if someone drops money, the dropping itself is a **proximate cause** and this causes us to choose whether to pick it up or return it, but this choice is not determined by an external actor, it **is determined by us.**

This is unlike for example if I’m riding a bike and there’s a roadblock, this I must dodge, **a principal cause** which leaves me with **no choice in the matter.**

**Our fated actions are up to us as long as their antecedent causes are auxiliary and proximate**

#### Wholism <a href="#_5x219hkh8p2c" id="_5x219hkh8p2c"></a>

We are part of something, we are not unique. We are connected to nature or to the human race for example. So stoicism tells us to “_**Play your part”.**_ This means to accept the natural order and choose a life that I can accept, by realizing I could do other stuff but if not I need to be aware of that and accept it.

I could live anywhere in the world but I choose not you.

Also certain parts we can’t play. Like I couldn’t be a professional basketball player, even if I try and I must be ok with that.

**My part: What I’m good at + What I like + What I can do**

#### Death <a href="#_axi9zce95jvf" id="_axi9zce95jvf"></a>

Since it’s going to happen either way, the virtuous should seek a noble death. One to be proud of.
