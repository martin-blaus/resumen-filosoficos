### Bio <a href="#_1k81k57xb67t" id="_1k81k57xb67t"></a>

(204 – 270) was a major Hellenistic philosopher who lived in Roman Egypt.

In his philosophy, described in the Enneads, there are three principles: the One, the Intellect, and the Soul. His metaphysical writings have inspired centuries of Pagan, Jewish, Christian, Gnostic, and Islamic metaphysicians and mystics, including developing precepts that influence mainstream theological concepts within religions, such as his work on duality of the One in two metaphysical states. This concept is similar to the Christian notion of Jesus being both god and man, a foundational idea in Christian theology.

**Neo Platonism**

### Metaphysics <a href="#_ar28bbl35xrv" id="_ar28bbl35xrv"></a>

The system can be divided between the invisible world and the phenomenal world, the former containing the transcendent One from which emanates an eternal, perfect, essence (_nous_, or intellect), which, in turn, produces the world-soul.

**Chain of being**

1. The One/God/The absolute/The Good
2. The intellect (nous)
3. The soul

We humans are in the last part of this chain, this is why we live in a flawed world we are just an image of an image of the absolute. This is why evil (the absence of good) can exist.

**The One**

It can be called god, or the Good. The One is so simple that it cannot even be said to exist or to be a being. It’s greater than the everything, it is in everything

**The nous** (Intellect)

Is emanated from The One, is a perfect image of the One and the archetype of all existing things. It is simultaneously both being and thought, idea and ideal world.

This is the world of Forms (plato) where true existence lies actually. This is where the concept of Tree for example exists.

**The soul**

Produced by the divine intellect, creator of matter, the sensible world. It is a catalytic between the world of form and physical matters.

**Upper soul**: Close to the nous

**Lower soul**: Closer to the external

**Matter**

The soul, as a moving essence, generates the corporeal or phenomenal world

For Plotinus unlike the stoics nature is lower than god, something that is created by the soul when looking to the sensible world instead of the nous

**The bad**

The bad is the absence of good, it only exists as in relation to good, if you take away the good you also take the bad

**Unity**

Everything has a certain amount of unity, in order to be considered a thing you need to have it. Like a marching band is not just a bunch of people with instruments, the quality of unity makes them a marching band. Something has more unity than others, the efficient cause of living things has more unity than something like a clock or even less a marching band. The more unity something has the more real it is.

**Book I**

Body and soul are to parts in constant tension, each one pushing its side.

Plotinus tries to understand to whom does pleasure and sorrow, fear and courage belong to? To the body or to the soul? How do they interact? How does the soul become aware of an affection?

1. It is a type of Idea, separate from the body, of energy that can’t interact with other energy
2. A type of combination that can receive ideas
3. Something entirely different from soul and body

Plotinus believes that the truth is that the soul and the body are intertwined together, and this is what makes an animal. In this mixture The soul can’t feel things so it requires the body to process it.

**Thing** → _affects →_ **Body** generates eidetic image → _reason→ **Soul**_

And what acts, what desires is not the body or the soul, but the animal (the composition)

But body and soul are not beings of equal right (as Aristotle had proposed) rather the body is subjected to the soul.

**The soul is superior → it exists**

**The body is inferior → it persists **_**(it needs the soul)**_

The body would be the ocean and the soul the ocean floor, one supporting the other not the other way around.

The soul remains imperturbable in itself, it radiates an eidetic image and when there’s a body that leans on it, then the soul stops being oriented towards the Nous and The One and it descends.

Humans is then a being that is _‘badly tied/united’_ it is condemned to death by its own ontological structure. Death being the release of the better part (soul) that returns to the divine.

We can therefore understand with this graph how the relation between body and soul and soul and nous is determined. And where does the human being sits (the mid-point)

**Book II - On Virtue**

In which things do we resemble god?

* **Political/Civic virtues** (Of the community): They make us more beautiful permanently, they make us better, limit desire. Like justice, courage, moderation.
* **Superior or purifying virtues:** Theological virtues pertaining to the ascent of the soul like faith, hope and charity

**The one has virtues→** irradiates **→ Humans (**Like a fire to a pan)

A soul is purified and enters a state where it doesn’t want vile things or sex, and does not have internal conflicts.

Virtues are a reflection of the nous

| **Nous** | <p>Model of virtue</p><p>↓</p> |
| -------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Soul** | Virtues                        |

When we ascend (from soul to The One) the virtues get closer and closer and become indistinguishable until they constitute themselves in The One/The Good.

**Prudence is the virtue of virtues.** Unlike Aristotle who proposed the medium of all states to be the virtuous, for Plotinus man must exceed from the mean and achieve a superior term into the Absolute. These are theological virtues that are not subject to the mean, they can’t be done in excess.

Man passes between different states in the way to the Absolute. Some stay in one, others (the striving or wise) ascend among them.

1. Simple mortal
2. Philosopher
3. Wise
4. Demonic
5. Divine

**Purification:** Is a righteousness of intention, one leans towards the absolute

**Sin or fault:** To fail to achieve something, it is not as tragic as with christian faith.

**Virtues are then just different types of purifications that allow us to get closer to a state of purity.**

**Book III - Dialectic**

**Dialectic:** Is the philosophical method of redirecting reason upwards towards The One. Is a habit that consists in explaining and understanding each thing, it’s about the good and the not-good.

Is the most important part of philosophy.

Man must try to move between states (see before Mortal → Divine). Those who are philosophers are like birds who have wings, they are by nature predisposed to ascend.

**The exercise of both virtue and dialectic are ontologically rooted in the souls desire for The Good,** where **virtue is ethical exercise** pertaining to souls **downward relation to body,** **dialectic is** the intellectual exercise **towards the noetic mind.**

**Book IV - Eudaimonia**

Happiness is generated in life, not only in the rational part.

A perfect and true life is only found in god. Man can’t have this but it can lean to it

Wellbeing therefore depends on the orientation of the soul towards the Good and not looking downwards (to the material) which can only lead to a disintegrated and incoherent soul. For example by looking for material things only for necessity, to understand the death of loved ones and let that affect it’s irrational part but not the rational.

There must be a unique end (final cause) and it has to be that closer to god, so the affections of the body can’t be part of this End.

We must distinguish the pains of the body and don’t see ourselves affected by it. (In great suffering is ok to release the body)

**Compared to other philosophies**

Unlike stoics, Plotinus believes that since man is composed of both a higher part (soul) and lower part (body), both parts need to have eudaimonia and not just one; if one part suffers it will make the other one also.

**The body should be cared for but only to have an instrumental purpose for a greater goal for the soul itself.**

**Book V - Can happiness be incremented in time?**

Happiness is something that happens in the present. _‘It is’._ True well being is an unchanging state.

Just from having been happy in the past one is not therefore happy in the present. One can not say that because of having been happier one is happier now since if we need to remember when we were happy it means we are not now.

**Quick summary**

Well being does not strictly fall into a human life for, to have eudaimonia we need to surpass the human form of life (mortal, philosopher, wise) in direction towards the demonic _(from eudaimonia)_ form and transcend this towards the Good. The man who has and follows this plan is the prudent one and inclines onto the Absolute

**Book VI - On beauty**

Beauty can be:

* By participation: The sensible world, like art and the body
* In itself: The intangible, like virtues

Beauty is symmetric and composed.

The first step in the ontological journey towards The One, is the encounter with Beauty which is all around us (music, colors…).

**The soul is made ugly by mixing itself with body and matter.** But, it is like mudded gold, **if cleaned** both gold and the soul **are beautiful as they were originally.**

To be able to contemplate Beauty we need to be purified, to work on ourselves to look up.

Plotinus writes:

_“Withdraw into yourself and look. And **if you do not find yourself beautiful yet,** act as does the creator of a statue that is to be made beautiful: he cuts away here, he smoothes there, he makes this line lighter, this other purer, until a lovely face has grown upon his work. So do you also: **cut away all that is excessive, straighten all that is crooked, bring light to all that is overcast, labour to make all one glow of beauty and never cease chiselling your statue, until there shall shine out on you from it the godlike splendour of virtue,** until you shall see the perfect goodness surely established in the stainless shrine”_

**Book VII - Evil**

**Book IX - ‘Suicide’**

We should not remove the soul from the body violently, rather it is supposed to stay with the body until this is decomposed. We may all have our times set by providence (_a stoic thought)_ and we should not alter that if that is the case.
