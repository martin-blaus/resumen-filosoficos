Aristotle

### Bio <a href="#_f5cplphdxvsg" id="_f5cplphdxvsg"></a>

384–322 BC. He was a Greek philosopher and polymath during the Classical period in Ancient Greece. Taught by Plato, he was the founder of the Lyceum, the Peripatetic school of philosophy, and the Aristotelian tradition. His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, esthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, psychology, linguistics, economics, politics, and government. Aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him. It was above all from his teachings that the West inherited its intellectual lexicon, as well as problems and methods of inquiry. As a result, his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the West and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion.

### Categories <a href="#_ww0ais89uoyx" id="_ww0ais89uoyx"></a>

0\. Substance

1. Quantity
2. Qualification
3. Relative
4. Place
5. Time
6. Being-in-a-position/posture/attitude
7. Having/State
8. Disposition/Action
9. Affection

It is not known why he chose 10 categories, we can supposed they are based on the answer to questions:

* What is? -> substance
* Where is it? -> location
* How many? -> Quantity
* ….

There’s no reason to assume there are no more categories.

We could define every category as “supreme genders” who are mutually exclusive and where every entity can be positioned, like individual columns. As a counterpart there are the specific entities like “horse” or “human” which can’t be divided into smaller entities and underneath them the individual entities like “Socrates” or ”Martin”

**Homonymous:** heterogeneous things that share a name (like the bow of a ship or an archer’s bow)

**Synonymous:** Homogeneous things that share a name.

**Paronymous:** Derivative words like brave from bravery

#### Predications <a href="#_qvb3zrsszuoq" id="_qvb3zrsszuoq"></a>

We can think of predication, not as a relation between words, but rather as an ontological matter. That is, as a relationship between the beings, or the entities, to which the words refer.

**Predications IN a subject**

The sentence, "Socrates walks" predicates one thing walking of another thing, Socrates.

Now Socrates is easy enough to think about and easily conceived of as not walking. He could stop and sit down for a chat with Euthyphro, for example. He does not need to be walking.

But can walking exist without Socrates? No. Walking needs a subject, an ontological subject, in order to exist. But Socrates doesn't need a subject.

Therefore Socrates is more fundamental, more of a being, more real than walking. For Aristotle, the more fully real entity is a concrete particular object familiar to us through experience, and not an otherworldly form, accessible only through the intellect like Plato believed

**Predications “said of “a subject**

It is a predication of said subject if it answers the question “what is?”

For example “Socrates is a human being” -> answers the question “What is Socrates”.

This is important for example in the context of Plato’s Euthyphro. Aristotle might say to Euthyphro, yes, the pious is loved by all the gods, but this is an inherent predication, not a said of predication. Being-loved-by-the-gods is something that belongs to piety, it is in piety, but it is not what piety is, so it is not said of piety.

Aristotle divides all beings in 2 categories

| **Particulars**                                                                       | **Universals**                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not _said of_ a subject                                                               | _Said of_ subject                                                                                                       |
| Socrates, Colmillo blanco, Brown                                                      | Human, Dog, Animal, Color                                                                                               |
| They are numerically one, they don’t have more specific instances that they belong to | <p>They belong to many particular things</p><p>A universal may be encapsulated in another universal (dog -> animal)</p> |

#### 4 fold classification of beings <a href="#_w8736egpkpmw" id="_w8736egpkpmw"></a>

(Substance as used here should actually be translated as “beingness” or even “reality”)

_“Primary substances have no subjects, but they are the subjects for everything else._

_What is called substance most fully, primarily, and most of all, is what is neither said of any subject nor in any subject. For instance, an individual man or horse”_ - Aristotle

For Aristotle the primary substance is one that is subject to change. That is unlike a color which is always the same (red is always red) a person for example can get darker or greyer (older). This view of the world is Heraclean and goes against the thought of Plato which thought like Parmenides there was no change.

**Another look at dependencies**

![](<../.gitbook/assets/1 (3).png>)

**IS**: Substantial Individual

**US**: Substantial Universal

1\. The preaching of a substantial universal of a substantial individual ("Socrates is a man")

2\. The preaching of a non-substantial universal of a non-substantial individual (“This color is white”)

3\. The preaching of a non-substantial universal of a substantial individual ("Socrates is white")

4\. The preaching of a non-substantial universal of a substantial universal ("The man is white" -> not all are white, it only shows that it is compatible)

**With this Aristotle inverts Plato's ontology.**

Platonic forms are said of the many X’s, so the many X’s are subjects for Platonic forms. So they are more real than Forms.

But for Aristotle the many beautiful things will be the subjects for the beautiful itself. And then many just things will be the subjects for the just itself, and so on. Therefore subjects are more fundamental, more real than the items that are predicated out of them.



#### The Categories <a href="#_te97lb4l2081" id="_te97lb4l2081"></a>

**Substance (being/entity)**

**Hylomorphism**: Conceives being (ousia) as a compound of matter and form.

Cannot be predicated of anything or be said to be in anything, can be divided in 2

**Primary**: These are subjects like Martin, Socrates.

They have absolute priority since they constitute the definition of existence of all other entities. US and U not S exists only as predication of IS and I not S exists only when inherited by a IS.

The distinctive trait of a primary substance is that it can receive contraries (it can change) for example a specific person can become whiter or darker (in the sun) but a human can’t become more human or a color can’t change, white is always white and never black.

**Secondary**: They can work as subjects and also as predicates like “Human”, aka _Universals_

In his book Metaphysics Aristotle will evolve his theory a bit more and will distinguish between matter and form, the latter being the substance itself instead of the entity

**Quantity**

This is the extension of an object, and may be either discrete or continuous. Further, its parts may or may not have relative positions to each other. All medieval discussions about the nature of the continuum, of the infinite and the infinitely divisible, are a long footnote to this text. It is of great importance in the development of mathematical ideas in the medieval and late Scholastic period. Examples: two cubits long, number, space, (length of) time.

#### Postpraedicamenta <a href="#_y0cbkpufe213" id="_y0cbkpufe213"></a>

**Opposition**

There are 4 types

1. Relative → double/half
2. Contrary → good/bad. Sometimes they have intermediaries like White <-Grey->Black
3. Deprivation and possession → Blindness/vision
4. Affirmation and negation → to be seated/ to not be seated

In relation to the existence of the subject

|                        | **Example**                   | **Subject exists**                                                           | **Subject doesn’t exists**                                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Contrary               | Socrates is good/is bad       | Either true or false                                                         | Both are false                                                   |
| Deprivation/Possession | Socrates has vision /is blind | <p>Either true or false</p><p>Or both can be false (socrates is neither)</p> | Both are false                                                   |
| Affirmation/Negation   | Socrates is seated/ is not    | Either true or false                                                         | Can be either true or false. (Can’t be seated if doesn’t exists) |

**Movement**

There are 6 possible actions: generation, destruction, increase, diminution, alteration, and change of place

### De anima <a href="#_2wu3ev95ytp4" id="_2wu3ev95ytp4"></a>

**Soul**: Today we could call this “mind”, not exactly what aristotle thought though.

**Aristotle thesis**: Everything is defined by its function, a thing is what it truly is when it’s capable of achieving its proper function.

**Functionalism (philosophy of mind)**

This theory made more popular in the late XX has it roots in Aristotle's though, it states that what makes something a mental state of a particular type does not depend on its internal constitution, but rather on the way it functions, or the role it plays, in the system of which it is a part

#### Soul <a href="#_ibab13ihdk8y" id="_ibab13ihdk8y"></a>

The soul is the form and the body is the matter.

For Greeks it differentiates between what is alive and what is not, a duck and rock.

All material items (like the body) require something to cohesion them, in beings this is the soul.

For Aristotle it’s the principle of life, all organics have soul. **It is the principle or cause of motion**.

He says: “_The soul must be the form of a natural body”._ His view is that a living thing is moved by its form not like Plato and others who believe the soul itself was in motion, for him the **soul is an unmoved mover**. (Like a builder who builds a house, he’s skill is the mover, that is the _form of a builder)_

**Movement**

**An activity is complete or perfect** **if its completeness is simultaneous** to the action, like “to see” or “think”. Instead i**t’s imperfect if it’s not an end**, like “building a house” which is only completed when the house is finished.



**Aristotle looks to understand:**

* Is the soul one indivisible or is it in parts
* Is the soul unique for all organisms, or each has a different one

Aristotle believes that the soul requires a body to perform an action, **without body there’s no soul,** this contradicts Plato's belief of the soul being pure and immortal.

For Aristotle the soul has the form of the body, which is what allows a living being to be alive, like the form of the eye allows it to see.



In this chapter Aristotle summarizes the thought on the soul of the presocratic (and plato). Mostly they believed the soul is in movement and it’s what moves everything.

He agrees with them in that there are **3 traits of the soul**:

* **Movement**
* **Sensitive perception**
* Incorporeal

But he argues that the **intellect is different than the soul** (unlike Anaxagoras):

If there were the same then a cow or a plant would have intellect and there are people who are smarter than others but have the same soul.

Against materialism, he argues that the soul can’t be made of x material (fire like Democritus thought or air like Anaxagoras) since that would mean every mental state is also a physical state, and Aristotle believes **there are certain mental activities that although require the body, they do not happen in the body**

Something is movement:

* **By itself:** Like a boat moves itself
* **By something else**: Like the sailors inside the boat

He disagrees with Plato’s claim that the soul moves in circles



In this chapter Aristotle discusses if the soul is a harmony, like discussed by Simias in _Fedon_, meaning it’s “ingredients” are in the right proportion. He explains the soul can’t be a harmony science, it can’t be an exact mixture in the body (it’s not evenly distributed, and for example if you cut a plant it can live so the soul can be divided?)

**Movement sometimes reaches the soul**, like sensations, and **sometimes proceeds from it**, like a remembrance.

Intellect is a certain substance that is not subject to destruction

**What is the soul made of?**

* One single element
* A mixture
* Every possible element (this would not be necessary since knowing a thing allows to know the contrary, like knowing cold is enough to know warm)

**Substance is given in 3 forms:**

* Matter
* Form
* What is composed of both

Matter is in **potentiality**, possibility that a thing can be said to have, and form in **actuality**, the motion, change or activity that represents an exercise or fulfillment of a possibility

Each further category must include the other, for example the nutritive part of the soul is the necessary condition for the other parts.

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2 (3).png>)

**The soul has 3 causes**:

* Material cause
* Formal cause
* Final cause

#### Sensation <a href="#_6yx0waw1y0p1" id="_6yx0waw1y0p1"></a>

It is either a potentiality (to have sight) or an act (to see)

The sensitive faculty is not in act but in power (like gas that does not catch fire) while the sensible (the object) is already an act.

Every sensitive organ is what constitutes the medium which it feels, like the eye is made of the particle of air.

**Touch**

It’s the primary sense, all animals must have it (or they would not be able to survive).

The body is the medium for the sense of touch, **what feels is the heart,** like the air is to the eye and vision. THe only difference is that we feel with the medium (with the body).

#### Intelect <a href="#_qqnt6dkiosgq" id="_qqnt6dkiosgq"></a>

Unlike the sensible **it does not have a sensitive organ** (like the heart or nose) it’s actually a separate part. The intellect itself **is intelligible as intelligible objects are**, that is, theoretical knowledge (what one knows) and the object of knowledge, are the same.

Divided in 2, **imagination,** it’s a movement produced by the act of sensation which is given in all animals (although deliberate imagination is only in rationals) and **judgement**

**Intelect** = Practical thinking (thinking with an end) + Theoretical thinking

**Desire puts animals in movement**, like a dog jumping or an actor performing.

Movement consists of 3 factors:

| **Movement part**  | **What is it**        | **Example**              |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Motor              | Object of desire      | Chocolate                |
| With what it moves | The faculty of desire | The longing of eating it |
| The moved          | The animal            | Me                       |

**Agent and Possible intellect**

They are not to parts of the intellect but rather to different functions of it.

The **possible intellect houses all concepts,** universal ideas like "triangle", "tree", "man", etc.

The **agent intellect recalls these ideas** from the possible intellect **and combines them** to form thoughts; it is the immortal and eternal part of the intellect.

**Without a passive** intellect t**here can’t be an active** intellect and **without active there can’t be a passive** (we need to learn to have the knowledge and we need the knowledge to apply it)

#### Book I <a href="#_3tbgmxipf1mk" id="_3tbgmxipf1mk"></a>

**State**

**How does it form?**

1. **Individual** → _Not self sufficient_
2. Man + Woman
3. Family
4. Villages
5. **State** → _Self sufficient,_ **therefore greater than the individual**

**Why is it good?**

**“Nature does things with 1 unique and good finality”**

1. Men do according for what's good
2. Associations of men therefore will also tend to good
3. The state is the most important of associations

The city originates for the sake of basic survival, but "it exists for the sake of living well” and any man that does not require the state to live is either a beast or a god.

**Household**

There are 3 relationships

* Master → Slave _(Has no will)_
* Husband → Wife _(Her will is subjugated)_
* Father → Children _(Has an incomplete will)_

**Master → Slave relationship**

Every art or science needs its unique instruments, the domestic science has slaves which are basically live instruments

**Is slavery just?**

Nature has authority in its core for example Soul → Body, Man → Woman. This relationship also exists between men who have a beautiful soul (master) and those who don’t (slave). It is therefore in the benefit of both parties to be master and slave.

But slaves captured in wars are unjust since they are not slaves due to their nature.



**Goods**

**Nature makes everything in order for men to acquire it.**

There are 2 types of goods:

* Natural
* Comercial (Where interest is the most contrary to nature, which is bad, since it’s money produced by money)

#### Book II <a href="#_v9wc33xct3yf" id="_v9wc33xct3yf"></a>

**Critique of Plato’s Republic**

* In breaking the family structure Plato destroys the unity of the state
* No private property means people won't take care of things with the same dedication, specially kids (which are shared)
* Without family bonds crime is more likely to happen
* Having Guardians and Protectors living differently than producers basically creates 2 different states



**Critique of Sparta**

* The board of overseers has many poor men on it who can be easily bribed
* The regime has become more like a democracy than an aristocracy
* Kingship should not be hereditary.
* They are skilled at winning wars but do not know how to be at leisure

#### Book III <a href="#_130js919clcx" id="_130js919clcx"></a>

**Who is a citizen?**

**One who has a share in ruling the city**, it’s not just someone who delibartes but someone who is part of the city's decision making. In a Whoever is entitled to participate in an office can change according to the regime of the state.

**What makes a state/city?**

It is not defined by its location or inhabitants, since one can change through births and deaths. Its **true identity is defined in its constitution (its regime)**

**Virtue of the citizen**

Is not one like that of a virtuous man but rather is **the capacity to rule and to be ruled.** Which can be learned only by being ruled. It is also important for **a magistrate to have skill,** this is as important as virtue.

**The virtue of a citizen is that which will lead to the preservation of the regime**

In a proper state artesans should not be citizens since only those who don’t need to work for a living and are properly educated should rule.

**Regimes**

**Correct regimes:** Looks to **the common good**, since "the city is a partnership of free and equal persons."

**Corrupt regimes:** Looks to **the advantage of who rules**

| Correct regime _(best to least good)_ | Perverted _(worst to least bad)_  | Who rules |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------- |
| Kingship                              | Tyranny                           | The King  |
| Aristocracy                           | Oligarchy → Poor ≠ Inferior       | The rich  |
| Republic                              | Demagogy → _Equally free ≠ Equal_ | The poor  |

_"The city is the partnership in living well . . . for the sake of a complete and self-sufficient life."_ Therefore th**e political partnership** is **not aimed merely toward living together but toward living nobly**. Those who contribute most to this partnership are consequently those who are most virtuous. The dispute over what type of regime there should be is, at its core, always a dispute about justice.

**Kingship**

There are 5 types:![](<../.gitbook/assets/3 (2).png>)

| <ol><li>Permanent generalship (like sparta)</li><li>Non hereditary tyranny</li><li>Dictatorship (elective tyranny)</li><li>King in heroic times: Based on law and not perpetual</li><li><strong>Absolute monarchy</strong></li></ol> |   | <p>Less power</p><p>More power</p> |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | - | ---------------------------------- |

The more equal the people are to it’s ruler the less just a monarchy is, therefore it depends on the virtue of the king and those around him what makes it just or unjust (f.e. for barbaric or for greeks )

**Law vs ruler**

**The majority is less corruptible** and it’s better at judging certain things. Therefore there are things were the majority should rule

_**“If 1 virtuous man judges well, then 2 will do even better”**._ The rule of the aristocracy is better than that of a single ruler.

**“**_**Where the law rules and the individual (even the king) won't be more than it”.**_ Having a personal rule allows desire and appetite to affect decisions and makes men unequal.

_**“Law is like intelligence without the blind passions”**._ Like the intellect of the soul rule without interference from appetite.

#### Book IV <a href="#_lg8yf5syspzj" id="_lg8yf5syspzj"></a>

The legislator **must not think of a perfect government, but rather one that is achievable** based on the existing states.

Among the city's inhabitants there are differences in wealth, trade, virtue, family and so on. **The regime is simply the arrangement of offices**.

**Main types of regimes**:

* **Oligarchy**: Power is concentrated (few and rich)
* **Democracy**: Power is shared (free and poor)

**Democracy**

kinds of democracy:

1. Based particularly on equality, where the poor and the well-off are treated equally and the majority rule since both groups have equal authority to rule.
2. Where citizens choose based on the law
3. Where the multitude and not the law to have authority. This allows demagogy and corruption

**Oligarchy**

There are several kinds of oligarchy:

1. Where there are property requirements for office.
2. Where the son succeeds the father
3. Where the officials rule rather than the law, this can lead to a dynasty.

**Republic or Polity**

**Is the highest form of government.** It’s **the combination of democracy and oligarchy.** Basically the doctrine of the mean applied to regimes.

**Examples**

|                                     | **Oligarchy**                   | **Democracy**                   | **Republic**           |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Magistrates**                     | Wealthy pays if absent          | Wealthy does not pay            | Wealthy pays if absent |
| Poor doesn’t get anything for going | Poor gets payment for assisting | Poor gets payment for assisting |                        |
| **Magistry selection**              | By designation                  | By luck                         | By designation         |
| Must have property                  | No property needed              | No property needed              |                        |

**Virtue of a city**

There are three parts of each city: the very wealthy, the very poor, and those in the middle.

The very poor are taught to live as slaves, while the very rich are thought to lead with despotism and don't know to obbey.

**When there’s a lot of disparity, jealousy and vanity are generated and citizens become enemies with each other.**

Therefore, as with everything, good states are those where the middle class has the power and it can avoid having rebelitions by the poor or tyranny from the rich.

_“The ambition of the rich has ruined more States than that of the poor”._

**Government offices**

Aristotle goes over the 3 powers, explaining who should be elected to be in each power and what they regulate **Legislative**, makes the law, **Executive** and **Judiciary**, who should solve factional conflicts to avoid revolutions.

#### Book V <a href="#_wytk891jg1rf" id="_wytk891jg1rf"></a>

_**“Every system who is truly just, it’s in practice radically false.”**_

**Revolutions**

**It’s always caused by inequality,** when there’s no compensation to the damaged party.

Neither pure democracy nor pure oligarchy are lasting because they each have an extreme view of equality which excludes one of the two types.

**In democracy the higher classes revolt,** because they believe having equal freedom means they are equal in everything, **while in an oligarchy the masses do, because** they believe because they are unequal in wealth they are unequal in everything.

Usually a **revolution will move from regime X to a more violent version of that same regime,** not to a complete different one (from aristocracy to oligarchy, not to democracy)

**The polity, in which the middle class rules and it’s closer to democracy is the most stable one.**

**Different types**

* From regime X to Y
* Change of leadership
* To fortify or reduce a principle
* To take or add something

**Causes of revolution**

* Disproportionate increase in one of the classes
* Race diversity (until breed mix is complete)
* Small constitutional changes → great effects (for example reelection first, indefinite later)
* Contempt from one class to the other
* Fear from punishment from one class to the other

**Causes of revolution in a democracy**

* Irresponsible behavior of popular leaders.
* If leader was a general it can become a tyranny

**Causes of revolution in an oligarchy**

* An inner oligarchy revolts
* Rise of a popular leader
* Oppression of the poor
* Military takes control

**Causes of revolution in an aristocracy**

* Similar to oligarchy but occur gradually
* Deviation of justice

**How to avoid a revolution**

* **Avoid derogating the law** in the sightless
* **Prevent** any **one person from becoming overly powerful** in a short period of time.
* Avoid factional conflicts in the ruling class
* **Avoid unproportionate superiority** of one class _(by having laws like a limit of wealth)_
* **Public office should ont enrich** those who occupy it (_so only those who are already wealthy will rule_)
* **Avoid corruption** or people will resent those who have rule and revolt
* Public officers should show their accounts to the people.
* In democracy avoid taking money from the rich, but in an oligarchy do so. **Either allow the ruling class to have full power or full wealth.**



**Monarchy**

Kingship and tyranny are distinguished from one another in that the tyrant seeks his own pleasure while the king seeks noble goals.

Tyranny is destroyed from the outside by a superior regime or from within by factional conflict.

**How to preserve it**

**Kingships**

* By limiting the king's authority
* It’s easy to overthrown if the masses don’t want it

**Tyranny**

3 main goals:

* **Moral abatement of citizens**
* **Sow mistrust**
* **Impoverishment and exhaustion**

In more detail:

* Can't be overthrown by the will of the masses.
* Killing potential rivals
* Control citizens (know why they are, avoid meetings)
* Accustom citizens to be submitted
* Use spies to seed distrust
* Antagonize citizens between each other
* Impoverish citizens, _One can’t think about conspiracies if work is all one does (building pyramids for example)_



**Tyrant itself**

* Look honest and merciful
* It should not be defiled
* Must be inaccessible, not talk to subjects
* **He must appear not as a despot, but as an administrator, l**ike a king, not someone who acts for his own benefit

**Critic to the Plato’s Republic**

He is wrong when he argues that there is a cyclical pattern of revolution for regimes. Regimes change from one to any of the other and more likely to a version similar but more violent of their current one

#### Book VI <a href="#_a12yms4mfuie" id="_a12yms4mfuie"></a>

**Democracy**

Justice is equality based on number rather than merit. The multitude have authority, meaning that the poor have more authority than the rich.

A second aspect of freedom is to live as one wants. Democratic people do not want to be ruled at all, but it is necessary to have rulers so an option is to rule and be ruled in turn.

**Characteristics:**

* Universal eligibility of all citizens for office
* Offices chosen by lot
* No repeat terms in office
* Short terms of office
* A popular jury, and a popular assembly with great authority.
* All offices are paid.

**The oligarchic principles lead to tyranny,** since if 1 man is wealthier than all other combined, then it’s due that he be the only ruler.

Meanwhile **democratic principles lead to injustice**, since the majority would distribute among each other the wealth of the rich.

_“Every man should be responsible to others**, nor should anyone be allowed to do just as he pleases; for where absolute freedom is allowed, there is nothing to restrain the evil which is inherent in every man**”_

**Essential offices**

Cult, war, contributions, public expenditure, police, market, ports and of the field.

#### Book VII <a href="#_a72q6wvqatz1" id="_a72q6wvqatz1"></a>

The state, as men, does not prosper without being virtuous. The concepts learnt in ethics apply to the state too. **The best state is one that, thanks to its laws, allows its citizens to practice virtue.**

**Indispensable conditions for the perfect state**

In all this conditions is important to see that the doctrine of the mean is apply to them\\

**Population**

It should be able to self sustain but at the same time should not allow easy infiltration

**Territory**

* Limit with land and sea for both economic and military advantages
* Natural water inside the city in case is sieged
* Fortified with walls
* Easy exit for citizens and difficult access for enemies
* A main plaza without commerce in front of the temple and another for commerce further away

**Natural condition of citizens**

It’s citizenship should be made of people who are brave and intelligent. Like the Greeks who are the mean between other civs.

| Europeans | Greeks      | Asians        |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Brave     | Brave       | Lack of heart |
| Idiots    | Intelligent | Intelligent   |

**Other**

* **Sustenance:** given by artisans who work for citizens
* **Art:** Needed for life
* **Enough wealth**: To survive hard times
* **Warriors**
* **Priestcraft**
* **Judgement**

The citizens should not be merchants, because they must work to live. They should be warriors when young and priests when old.

A state that only thinks of conquest can’t be happy since it’s citizens will always want to usurp it. (Combat should be trained for defense). A **legislator should only create good feelings in the heart of its citizens.**

#### Book VIII <a href="#_jonn76d4eg9e" id="_jonn76d4eg9e"></a>

**Raising children**

**The legislator's primary concern should be the education of the young,** wrong education can be the end of the state.

**Education must be public and in common**, since there is a single end for the city as a whole there should be a single education.

Raising children should be regulated with a view to helping them grow strong physically and habituating them in virtue. They should be allowed to scream and cry since it’s a way of development.

**They should not learn the craft of the laborer or the slave**, since this is not useful to prepare a man in the practice of virtue.

**Leisure secures pleasure**, wellness and happiness are not found by those who only work. Due to this **children should also learn music and other things that are neither useful or necessary**, but worthy of the virtuous man. And learning something can later help understand it and enjoy it properly.

### Nicomachean Ethics <a href="#_v3idlx4s07z" id="_v3idlx4s07z"></a>

Aristotle's is considered the first real writer on ethics, although Socrates had talked about it before.

#### Book I <a href="#_g4f05q4gyq4x" id="_g4f05q4gyq4x"></a>

**The good is that to which all things tend towards.**

The end of an action is either an activity, like health is to medicine, or an object like a house is to building.

**The end of X is preferable to the end of the subordinates of X,** building a building is less than all construction as an end.

**Politics:** Aristotle refers to politics as what we would call **practical philosophy**. This is something that all citizens must learn and use and is the father to other sciences like economics or strategy.

The study of politics is meant for those who can apply reason and are not incontinent (those who know what to do but don’t cause they are governed by desire).

**To what end does politics tend to?**

Everyone agrees that one must act good in order to live happy, but disagrees what it means to be happy. Some are materialist (having wealth) others like Plato believe there is an Idea of good.

**Ways of living:**

* **Pleasure:** This is the life of common men who follows the life of beast, this is guided by desire and justified by seeing how other powerful men behave
* **Politics (Honor):** This is for men of action and instructed who follow virtue but more for themselves than for virtue itself, they could spend their whole life without actually applying it
* **Theoretical life (contemplation):** See Book X

**Critic to Plato’s Ideas**

1. Some substances can’t have before or after, like numbers who each is based on the one before and are unique or geometrics forms where there is no superior
2. Each particular good is divided into the 10 categories, there’s no main and unique category
3. There is no unique science but rather many and related.
4. The idea of something (like “white” vs something white) is not better just because it is eternal.
5. There can’t be a unique definition of Good, since for example honor or wisdom have different definitions

If Good is an idea or a separate thing that exists by itself, like Plato says, this is irrelevant for the study of ethics since it is not something man can achieve. Like a doctor doesn’t search for Good but rather for achievable things like health which is a subtype of Good.

**Eudaimonia (Happyness or better the action of it, flourishing)**

**It is better to follow a Good that is complete in itself,** like happiness which is followed for happiness itself, unlike honor or intellect which are followed in order to be happy.

Therefore happiness is the ultimate Good, although Aristotle believes we can add more to it, the more Goods we follow the better since they add up (110%)

The function of men is that of reason (given the 3 parts of the soul is the one unique to us) and we need to exercise that with virtue (with excellency) and in our complete life (not just a day) to do it right.

**Type of things**

* **External**: Necessary for a greater joy, lack of good friends or ugliness diminish happiness, material things complement happiness (like crying in a mercedes)
* **Soul**: This are the actions we take, it’s the primary type of good
* **Body**

Only those who act correctly can possess the good things in life, those who love what’s good and noble will find noble things naturally pleasurable.

#### Book II <a href="#_2l4zuv5woc68" id="_2l4zuv5woc68"></a>

Ethics can’t be fixed and universal since it always depends on the specific action we analyze.

**Virtues**

* **Dianoetic:** They belong to the part of reason of the soul, they get better through teaching
* **Ethic (or moral)**: They belong to the part of the apetite (the irrational) but can obey reason, it comes from customs. It’s a state while choosing is the medium

**They are not originated by nature**, since what is by nature can’t be accustomed to something else (like a rock can’t be accustomed to _fall_ upwards).

**We have the capacity of acquiring virtues**, and like a skill we need to execute it in order to have it. Doing just actions → makes us just. doing unjust → makes us unjust

In summary **“virtues/states are made from activities”** (specially when we are young) and it’s **not just about studying them, one must apply them.**

Virtues are related to pleasures and pain, since we act based on the consequences of an action (based on experience or teaching)

**Virtue of character as means**

**Virtues are destroyed in both excess and defect.** Being a coward or reckless will both lead to ruin. Therefore **virtue is found in the middle point of action (**the mean relative to us, eating what is right for us not for a strongman) **except for those actions that are inherently bad,** like killing, those are always wrong since it would either be an excess of an excess or a defect of adefect.

_“Virtue then is a settled disposition of the mind determining the choice of actions and emotions, consisting essentially in the observance of the mean relative to us, this being determined by principle, that is as the prudent man would determine it.”_ - NE 1106b

#### Book III/IV <a href="#_2gmh9i5s91kd" id="_2gmh9i5s91kd"></a>

**Actions**

* **Voluntary**
* **Involuntary:** When we don’t know the all the circumstances or can’t avoid it (actions performed being drunk f.e. is not actually involuntary since we chose to be that way)
* **Mixed (non voluntary)**: When one is forced to perform an action because of a threat for example

**Choices**

_“Choice will be a deliberate desire of things in our power; for we first deliberate, then select, and finally fix our desire according to the result of our deliberation”_ - NE 1113b

Therefore **being virtuous does not depend on what we want but rather on our actions**. (Like wanting to be healthy is not enough to be)

#### Doctrine of the mean <a href="#_fzfmne670o5c" id="_fzfmne670o5c"></a>

**Deliberation**

How we think through the ways we can try to achieve our ends. Choice is decided by both desire and deliberation.

We can divide **moral virtues** into its defect, mean and excessive behaviour, the mean being the virtuous one:

| **Concerned with** | **Defect**                | **Mean**   | **Excess**                 |
| ------------------ | ------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------- |
| Fear               | Coward                    | Courage    | Audacity                   |
| Pleasure           | Insensible (rare)         | Temperance | Profligacy (_libertinaje_) |
| Anger              | Spiritlessness (Flanders) | Gentleness | Irascibility               |

Other examples of moral virtues that can be achieved by finding the mean are:

* **Generosity**: Concerned with giving and getting small or big money
* **Magnificence**: Concerned with giving and getting greater things
* **Magnanimity:** Concerned with great honor and dishonor
* **Friendliness:** Concerned with pleasantness in life



**The magnanimous (great souled) person**

* They take few things seriously, and are not anxious.
* They don’t love danger but face it when it’s important without fearing for themselves
* They gladly do favors but are ashamed to receive them
* Is pleased with honors of other virtuous but not from ordinary men
* They lead life as they choose and not as suits others, which would be slave-like.
* Doesn’t hold grudges nor serves any other and speaks and acts openly.
* Don’t talk about themselves or others since they are not concerned about praise or attacking others.

#### Book V <a href="#_vep4ovr53hky" id="_vep4ovr53hky"></a>

**Justice**

It’s the same as virtue, when we consider virtue in relationship to others, it can be divided in:

* **General → To be law abiding**
* **Particular → To be equitative**
  * Distributed: Equals for equals
  * Corrective: Take one to give to another (to make it equal):

_"Whatever is unfair is lawless, but not everything lawless is unfair”._

**Injustice are the extremes while justice is the middle,** the judge would be the mediator who tries to make both parties receive the equal.

**Money is the middle term** that allows everyone to have an equal relationship **since it measures everything** and allows to pair different labor (Buying X thing for W, while I sell Z for T)

We can also divide Justice in 2 origins:

* **By nature**: It’s the true, primary justice
* **By law**: It changes according to every city it can coincide with natural justice, and it’s the job of the judge to interpret it correctly in order for that to happen.

#### Book VI <a href="#_x6c37e8wr1un" id="_x6c37e8wr1un"></a>

The part of the soul with reason is divided:

* One whereby we contemplate the things with invariable causes
* One whereby we contemplate the variable thing and deliberate concerning action

**5 states of the soul**

**Art**

It’s rational, because **it involves making things deliberately,** in a way that can be explained.It concerns intermediate aims like a house is built not for its own sake, but to have a place to live

**Knowledge** _(Episteme)_

We all assume that **what we know is not capable of being otherwise**.

**Practical Judgement** _(phronesis)_

This is the judgement used in deciding **what is good or bad for humans** (the aim of living well overall)**. It’s related to political art.** Aristotle distinguishes skilled deliberation from knowledge, because we do not need to deliberate about things we already know (like Math).

**Intellect** (_Nous_)

Is the capacity we develop with experience, to grasp the sources of knowledge and truth. Unlike knowledge, **it deals with unarticulated truths**. It’s not a type of reasoning, rather it is a perception of the universals that can be derived from particular cases, including the aims of practical actions.

**Wisdom**

It’s **the combination of intellect and knowledge**, it is concerned about higher things. For example it would be concerned with health while “practical judgement” would be concerned with medical knowledge

#### Book VII <a href="#_lyp5lofly81e" id="_lyp5lofly81e"></a>

**Incontinence (**_**akrasia)**_

There is no evil in beasts (animals) and the goodness of gods is greater than virtue.

**Temperance**: Is a means (the middle) with regards to pleasure. It is a virtuous person whose desires are in line with the right reason so that virtuous action is pleasant. (_not a hedonist since reason is involved)_

**Continence**: One who attends to reason, acts according to virtue and does so for the right reason but his desires are bad.

**Incontinence:** It strays from reason and performs bad actions knowingly due. Aristotle's argues that one can be incontinent even having knowledge (unlike how Socrates proposed) since:

* One can know in potentiality but not in act. (to have knowledge but to not apply it)
* One can know the universal but not the particular (like knowing some foods are bad but not which ones)
* Desires can put us in a state of incontinence, like if we were drunk



Things that produce pleasure:

* **Necessary (of the body)**: This are by nature, like eating or sex.
  * Absolute
  * Related to humans
* **Contrary**: This are morbid pleasures, perversions of nature like being _homosexual_ or eating coal. They can occur due to:
  * Given by nature (like a psychopath)
  * Getting used to (being abused in childhood)
  * A defect or illness on birth
* **Intermediate (of the soul)** : Things like honor, wealth and goods which are not inherently bad to pursue.

**Pleasures are not in itself bad**, there are some pleasures which are good. The temperate man avoids excessive bodily pleasures but pursues pleasures in moderation.

**Akolasia (Intemperate, vicious)**

The man who pursues the excesses of pleasurable things through intention is intemperate. Such a man is not disposed to regret and is incurable. The intemperate man is worse than the incontinent, since incontinence is a kind of softness while intemperance is deliberately disgraceful. Chooses for their own sake wrong actions without even knowing they are wrong, and feel no regrets

**Summary**

|                 | **Desire**                | **Reason** | **Action** |
| --------------- | ------------------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| **Virtuous**    | ✅ _(has trained desires)_ | ✅          | ✅          |
| **Continent**   | ❌                         | ✅          | ✅          |
| **Incontinent** | ❌                         | ✅          | ❌          |
| **Vicious**     | ❌                         | ❌          | ❌          |

#### Book VIII <a href="#_o09ibb53mql0" id="_o09ibb53mql0"></a>

**Friendship**

It’s important since it’s the basis of a just society and it’s a mandatory part in order to achieve happiness

**It’s a form of virtue, it is necessary to life,** since no one would choose to live without friends even if he had all other material goods. **True (complete) friendship is that in which both parties want what is good for each other**, both should like similar things in order to like spending together, also **there’s equality and similarity**, and nor should accuse or recriminate the other (f.e. with economic debt)

An incomplete friendship where one does not regard friends as people, but for what they can give in return happens when it’s due to:

* **Pleasure**: Best of both and common in young people who quickly change what they like
* **Utility**

Evil people can only find this type of friendship and it doesn’t last very long

**Friendship among not equals**

There are relationships where **one party is superior:**

* Father → Son
* Old → Young
* Husband → Wife

When there’s too much difference there can’t be friendship like with God → Humans or King → Lower class

The **superior part should always receive more from the inferior** and is never in debt to the inferior although it should forgive their debts.

**Friendships as political systems**

| Form of government _(best to least good)_ | Deviation _(worst to least bad)_ | Relationship                 |
| ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Kingship                                  | Tyranny                          | Father → Son                 |
| Aristocracy                               | Oligarchy                        | _Superiority based on merit_ |
| Democracy                                 | Mob Rule                         | Brother → Brother            |

In any **deviated relationship there can’t be an actual friendship,** a tyranny is more like a master and slave (“**A slave is like an animate tool** and a tool an inanimate slave”)

**Where there is friendship, justice is not necessary.** Yet where there is justice friendship is still necessary. While **friendship is reciprocal**, the principal virtue of a friend is to love rather than to be loved. While **justice requires a strict reciprocity** according to **merit, friendship can exist in an unequal relationship because the inequality is in some way bridged by the love of the friends.**

Therefore the more just the regime is, the more friendship there will be among the people of that regime

#### Book IX <a href="#_b24fq46sn2ew" id="_b24fq46sn2ew"></a>

**Friends are considered to be the greatest of external goods**

Since a virtuous friend would be a choiceworthy object for a virtuous man, **having friends is necessary for happiness.**

it is reasonable to **end the friendship when one of the two people changes** such that the relationship is no longer useful or pleasurable

**If the other friend is beyond correction, it fine to end the friendship but one must try to help the other first**

**Better men avoid sharing their grief with their friends**, because they don't want to cause sorrow to their friends. **We should be eager to invite our friends to share in our good fortune but slow to have them share in our bad fortune.** Further, it is good to go uninvited to help friends in a state of misfortune

#### Book X <a href="#_4kuu50fp9e20" id="_4kuu50fp9e20"></a>

**Pleasure is not a movement**, it has no end point when we can say it is completed. **It is either happening in a complete way or not happening.**

**We all aim for pleasure**

1. Living is a form of activity
2. Each one exercises activities in relation to the things he loves
3. There is pleasure in completing those activities
4. Therefore there is pleasure in living

To be happy is to act according to virtue, which is to act in a certain way. **This highest activity, Aristotle says, must be contemplation (**_**theōrētikē**_**).** This is also the most sustainable, pleasant, self-sufficient activity, serious, something aimed at for its own sake.

Only God can do this all the time but men should do it as much as possible.

_“For if, as is generally believed, the gods exercise some superintendence over human affairs, then it will be reasonable to suppose that they take pleasure in that part of man which is best and most akin to themselves, namely the intellect, and that they recompense with their favors those men who esteem and honor this most. Now it is clear that all these attributes belong most of all to the wise man. H**e therefore is most beloved by the gods**; and if so, he is naturally most happy. Here is another proof that **the wise man is the happiest**” -_ NE 1179a

_“Nurture and exercises of the young should be regulated by law, since temperance and hardiness will not be painful when they have become habitual._” - NE 1179 b

#### Miscellaneous <a href="#_1dn2q1vb1kmz" id="_1dn2q1vb1kmz"></a>

_**How should we live?**_

Aristotle thinks we should ask “What is the goal of life”? known as the _telos_ (goal) question.

Aristotle explains that every action seems to aim at some good, that good is the point of the goal of that activity. Even activities like sports or watching tv have a goal, to enjoy it. And some activities are themselves the goal like playing music or football.

Aristotle allows that one can have a plurality of goals (like playing a sport, learning a language, having fun with friends) but still have a unique further goal.

He explain that **goals exists in nested hierarchies,** for example:

A morning ritual actually consists on multiple goals:

1. I want to **brew coffee**
2. I brew it cause I want to **drink coffee**
3. I drink it cause I want to **code better**
4. I want to code better so I can be a **better developer**

So Aristotle believes there is no problem with having **lots of different goals** in life as long as each of them has a place in a nested hierarchy of goals that **converges in a single goal at the top**

But Aristotle explains that we **should not value the minor goals just in sake of the top goal**, but also for their own sake. Goals like being healthy are valuable on its own.

Aristotle believes that the final goal should be an activity, not an actual thing (like having more money or knowing more stuff) but actually something you engage while pursuing the subordinate goals**. It is what you are doing in pursuing those goals**

#### Standards for living a good life <a href="#_s4rikvphr09z" id="_s4rikvphr09z"></a>

They are what **guide a person as he makes choices in pursuit of his goals**, for example playing the piano may be my goal but I wouldn’t do it in the middle of the night and annoying other tenants or I wouldn’t stealing others people work promote my career

Aristotle says that **everyone agrees that living well is the goal of life**, he calls this “_**eudaimonia**_” (which is not very rightly translated as happiness)

But we can disagree regarding what _eudaimonia_ is and what the standards for living are (for Socrates it was Justice for example)

Aristotle rejects pleasure as the goal of life, he thinks it's part of a good life, but it needs to be regulated by some further end.

For him **reason** is the distinct human activity or function that differentiates us from other organisms, based on this he proposes that as for teacher whose function is to teach, or a dancer to dance, the function of humans is to reason.Therefore **living well for a human is to use exercise the virtue of reason.**

**Virtue of character**

Aristotle divides the soul in 3 parts:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/4 (1).png>)

1. **Shared with plants**: governs growth, nutrition and respiration and is oblivious to reason.
2. **Shared with animal:** This can follow or not reason (it is like the appetite and spirits of the platonic soul)
3. The human part that reasons.

A soul that has achieved **total harmony between the non** reason and reason (a just soul for Plato) this person has achieved “_virtue of character”._

He gives examples of virtues of character like:

* Courage: Stand their ground when appropriate and are not afraid at wrong time
* Generous: Help other worthy of it for the right reasons
* Temperate: Will avoid excessive indulgence without regret.
* ….

People with virtues of character **adhere to standards for living well,** they regulate their pursuit of the good based on the standard. **Living up to those standards is their goal in life.**

**The life of Theôria**

Theoria: study or non passive contemplation

By study he means the active condition of knowing something, really grasping it.

He differentiate knowledge in 2 ways the one we have but don’t use and the one we actually use (this is his theôria)

For him God is wholly intellectual, it is in a permanent state of theôria, it is the activity of intellect.

Aristotle explains that as humans we are not capable of ceaselessly engaging in theoria as the gods do, so the political life, a life with virtue of character (with courage, justice, generosity…) is **the second best life** that concerns the way we conduct human affairs.

But **the life of theôria is (**or would be) **the best life**, the life gods live.

He says, we ought not to follow the proverb _"think mortal, since you are mortal"_. Rather, as far as we can, **we ought to be like the immortals (**_athanatizein_**), and go to all lengths to live a life that expresses our supreme element; for however much this element may lack in bulk, by much more it surpasses everything in power and value.**

### Metaphysics <a href="#_wpidlrg8lzsa" id="_wpidlrg8lzsa"></a>

**Motion**: In greek “Kinesis” means change

#### The mover & the moved <a href="#_jdwdl9a6sfx7" id="_jdwdl9a6sfx7"></a>

The move is the _subject of change_, like water that boils heated by fire or a window that breaks when hit by a ball.

The mover is the _cause of change_, the ball or the fire in the previous example

![](<../.gitbook/assets/5 (1).png>)

For a change to occur both mover and moved need to be in the right condition (teacher near the pupil)

**The argument for the first change in the universe**

1. Suppose at time 1 there is no change in the cosmos and at time 2 the first change occurs
2. So, at Time 2, the MOVER and MOVED exist and are in the right conditions for the first change in the cosmos but at Time 1, this is not the case.
3. So, something must have changed between Time 1 and Time 2.
4. So there was a change before the first change in the cosmos.

Since step 4 contradicts step 1, this is “reductio ad absurdum” or “reductio” (disprove a hypothesis by showing that something absurd follows from it.)

#### The first “unmoved” mover <a href="#_q69w7jqn6he2" id="_q69w7jqn6he2"></a>

We need to think about it, not as a mover that is first in time but rather Aristotle looks to explain what keeps the cycles of change ongoing. This is based on his theory of the cosmos where the movement of the sun makes the Earth change, and something makes the sun change, etc…

To solve this Aristotle says _“There must be something that is itself unmoved and outside of all change.. but initiates motion in something else”._

**Self mover**

If the first mover is moved, but not by the agency of something else, _it necessarily follows that it is moved by its own agency._ Like a man hitting a ball with a stick, **the soul of the man** is the unmoved mover while the hand, stick are movers and the ball is the moved.

**God**

On Aristotle's theology, he says, god is always in the good state that we are in sometimes

Aristotle defines “first philosophy” (later known as metaphysics) as the study of the universal principles of being, the abstract qualities of existence itself. Being can be said in different classes of predicates: the substance (Socrates is a man), quality (Socrates is ugly), location (Socrates in the agora), etc..

Perhaps t**he starting point of Aristotle's metaphysics is his rejection of Plato's Theory of Forms.** In Plato's theory, material objects are changeable and not real in themselves; rather, they correspond to an ideal, eternal, and immutable Form by a common name, and this Form can be perceived only by the intellect. Thus a thing perceived to be beautiful in this world is in fact an imperfect manifestation of the Form of Beauty**. Aristotle's arguments against this theory were numerous. Ultimately he rejected Plato's ideas as poetic but empty language; as a scientist and empiricist he preferred to focus on the reality of the material world.**

**Book I - First Causes and Principles**

There is experience, the knowledge of individual things and art/science is the knowledge of general things.

The nature of wisdom: it begins with sense perceptions, which must be translated into scientific expertise. Such knowledge requires the understanding of both facts and causes, and wisdom comes only with an understanding of the universal principles and primary causes built on this science.

**Love of philosophy**

_“It is through wonder that men now begin and originally began to philosophize; wondering in the first place at obvious perplexities, and then by gradual progression raising questions about the greater matters too, e.g. about the changes of the moon and of the sun, about the stars and about the origin of the universe”_

_“Clearly then it is for no extrinsic advantage that we seek this knowledge; for just as we call a man independent who exists for himself and not for another, so we call this the only independent science, since it alone exists for itself.”_

**Metaphysics, the science of the divine**

_“Although **all other sciences are more necessary than this, none is more excellent**.”_

**Book II - Principles of Physics**

Aristotle explains causes can’t be infinite, like the material causes x can happen from x -1, but that can’t go on to the infinite. Same with the other causes. **There must be a first principle of the generation that can not itself be destroyed**

**Book III - The 14 Aporias**

For Plato there are:

* **The One**: the principle of unity that makes things definite and determinate
* **The Indefinite Dyad**: the principle of 'indeterminacy' and 'unlimitedness' (The great and the small)

These 2 are the foundation of everything throughout the world of ideas, the one produces things by making determinate the indeterminate magnitudes of the great and the small.

Aristotle will criticize this concepts for the rest of the book

**Aristotle asks the following questions and more:**

Is there a single science of causes or more? Is there a separate form of the compound individual? What is the unity and identity of the formal principles? Being and the One they are the substance of things or do they depend on a substrate? Are the principles universal or individual? The principles are in power or act? Mathematical objects (numbers and figures) are they substances?

**Book IV- Being as being logical and Principles**

_“For some things are said to "be" because they are substances; others because they are modifications of substance; others because they are a process towards substance, or destructions or privations or qualities of substance, or productive or generative of substance or of terms relating to substance, or negations of certain of these terms or of substance. (Hence we even say that not-being is not-being.)And so, just as there is one science of all healthy things, so it is true of everything else.”_

_“Now if Being and Unity are the same, i.e. a single nature, in the sense that they are associated as principle and cause are, and not as being denoted by the same definition (although it makes no difference but rather helps our argument if we understand them in the same sense),since "one man" and "man" and "existent man" and "man" are the same thing, i.e. the duplication in the statement "he is a man and an existent man" gives no fresh meaning”_

\
**Prime mover**

_“Nor, as is obvious, are those right who say that all things are at rest; nor those who say that all things are in motion. For if all things are at rest, the same things will always be true and false, whereas this state of affairs is obviously subject to change; for the speaker himself once did not exist, and again he will not exist. And if all things are in motion, nothing will be true, so everything will be false; but this has been proved to be impossible.Again, it must be that which is that changes, for change is from something into something. And further, neither is it true that all things are at rest or in motion sometimes, but nothing continuously; for there is something which always moves that which is moved, and the "prime mover" is itself unmoved”_

**Book V - Definitions**

**Causes**

* **Material**: “_in one sense, that as the result of whose presence something comes into being—e.g. the bronze of a statue and the silver of a cup.”_
* **Form**: _“that is, the essential formula and the classes which contain it—e.g. the ratio 2:1 and number in general is the cause of the octave—and the parts of the formula.”_
* **Efficient: **_**“**The source of the first beginning of change or rest; e.g. the man who plans is a cause, and the father is the cause of the child, and in general that which produces is the cause of that which is produced, and that which changes of that which is changed.“_
* **End/Final:** _”E.g., as the "end" of walking is health. For why does a man walk? "To be healthy," we say, and by saying this we consider that we have supplied the cause. All those means towards the end which arise at the instigation of something else, as, e.g. fat-reducing, purging, drugs and instruments are causes of health”_

**Accident**:_”as also another sense. namely, whatever belongs to each thing in virtue of itself, but is not in its essence; e.g. as having the sum of its angles equal to two right angles belongs to the triangle. Accidents of this kind may be eternal, but none of the former kind can be. There is an account of this elsewhere”_

**Book VI - Being, accident and truth.**

Physics is about mobile and material things

Math is about immobile and material things

Metaphysics is about non material and immobile things

If there was only mater, then physics would be the first philosophy

**Book VII (Z, Zeta, 1028a, 1041b) The Substance v**

**Being**

_“The term "being" has several senses, which we have classified in our discussion of the number of senses in which terms are used. It denotes first the "what " of a thing, i.e. the individuality; and then the quality or quantity or any other such category. Now of all these senses which "being" has, the primary sense is clearly the "what," which denotes the substance and all other things are said to "be" because they are either quantities or qualities or affections or some other such thing.”_

_"What is Being?"—is in other words \`What is substance?\` Some say that it is one, others, more than one; some, finite; others, infinite._

**Substances**

* Essence
* Universal
* Gender
* Subject/Substrate

_**“Now in one sense we call the matter the substrate; in another, the shape ; and in a third, the combination of the two**._

_By **matter** I mean, for instance, **bronze**; by **shape**, the **arrangement of the form**; and by the **combination of the two, the concrete thing: the statue**. Thus if **the form is prior to the matter and more truly existent, by the same argument it will also be prior to the combination.**_

**Essence**

_“**The essence of each thing is that which it is said to be per se**. "To be you" is not "to be cultured," because you are not of your own nature cultured. Your essence, then, is that which you are said to be”_

**Book VIII - Potentiality and actuality**

_“Hence in defining the nature of a house, **those who describe it as stones, bricks and wood, describe the potential house,** since these things are its matter; **those who describe it as "a receptacle for containing goods and bodies,"** or something else to the same effect, de**scribe its actuality;** but **those who combine these two definitions** describe the third kind of substance, that which is composed of matter and form. From the foregoing account it is clear what sensible **substance is, and in what sense it exists; either as matter, or as form and actuality, or thirdly as the combination of the two.“**_

**Book IX/X - Being as power and Entelechy, being as true/The One and the Many**

_“Since one element is formula and the other matter, **contrarieties in the formula produce differences in species,** but contrarieties in the concrete whole do not. **Hence the whiteness or blackness of a man does not produce this, nor is there any specific difference between a white man and a black man**; not even if one term is assigned to each. For we are now regarding "man" as matter, and matter does not produce difference; and for this reason, too, **individual men are not species of "man,"** although the flesh and bones of which this and that man consist are different.\`\`_

**Book XI - Summary of the being and becoming**

Read this in the future for more summarized details

**Book XII - separated substances and the Prime Mover**

There are 3 kinds of substance:

* Changeable and perishable (e.g., plants and animals)
* Changeable and eternal (e.g., heavenly bodies)
* Immutable

If all substances are perishable, then ultimate destruction of everything is inevitable. **But Aristotle asserts two imperishable entities: motion and time.**

**If time were created, then there must have been no time before the creation, but the very concept of "before" necessitates the concept of time**.

On the other hand, as he argued in his works of natural philosophy, **the only continuous motion must be circular.** Thus he returns to the idea of **the** **Unmoved Mover, for only such a being could generate eternal circular motion**. **The Unmoved Mover is the ultimate cause of the universe, and it is pure actuality,** containing no matter since it is the very cause of itself. In order for the Mover to be unmoved itself, it must move in a non-physical way, by inspiring desire.

“There is something which is eternally moved with an unceasing motion, and that circular motion. This is evident not merely in theory, but in fact. Therefore the "ultimate heaven" must be eternal. Then there is also something which moves it.And since that which is moved while it moves is intermediate, there is something which moves without being moved; something eternal which is both substance and actuality.”

Aristotle asserts that it is a living creature and represents the pinnacle of goodness, it also has no interest in the world and no recognition of man, for it exists in a completely transcendent and abstract state. The activity of God–if it can be called such–is simply knowledge, and this knowledge is purely a knowledge of itself.

“_Hence it is actuality rather than potentiality that is held to be the divine possession of rational thought, and **its active contemplation is that which is most pleasant and best**. **If, then, the happiness which God always enjoys is as great as that which we enjoy sometimes, it is marvellous;** and if it is greater, this is still more marvellous. Nevertheless it is so. Moreover, life belongs to God. For the actuality of thought is life, and God is that actuality; and the essential actuality of God is life most good and eternal. **We hold, then, that God is a living being, eternal, most good; and therefore life and a continuous eternal existence belong to God; for that is what God is**.”_

The idea of human gods is a of mythological that happens due to generation after generation, but the divine is true

_“A tradition has been handed down by the ancient thinkers of very early times, and bequeathed to posterity in the form of a myth, to the effect that these heavenly bodies are gods and that the Divine pervades the whole of nature.**The rest of their tradition has been added later in a mythological form to influence the vulgar and as a constitutional and utilitarian expedient**; t**hey say that these gods are human in shape or are like certain other animals…** Now if we separate these statements and accept only the first, that they supposed the primary substances to be gods, we must regard it as an inspired saying and reflect that whereas every art and philosophy has probably been repeatedly developed to the utmost and has perished again, these beliefs of theirs have been preserved as a relic of former knowledge. To this extent only, then, are the views of our forefathers and of the earliest thinkers intelligible to us.”_

**Book XIII-XIV (M, Mu, 1076a-1087a) Critique of Platonic Ideas**

### Physics <a href="#_eb7ii3fbqse4" id="_eb7ii3fbqse4"></a>

_This book provides good insight on Plato’s Timaeus_

For Aristotle, all substances can be analyzed into matter and form.

He explains that matter becomes form, bronze becomes a statue, or the elements (for him it was earth, fire, air and water become a being)

To answer Parmenides' challenge he says, Every change involves an underlying subject that was there at the beginning, so change does involve coming into being from what is not.

**What is (a) nature?**

Aristotle says that a natural body has within itself a principle of motion or change. A deer moving from one place to another like a ball which is thrown.

Regarding fire, air, water and earth he explains they are natural bodies. He assigned to them a specific place (earth is heavier than air therefore it goes downwards…). But the question arises is if a chair also goes downwards (and according to aristotle it’s mainly made of earth) is the chair a natural body? He explains that it is not since what tends to go downwards is the earth in the chair not the chair itself._**The movement belongs to the chair coincidentally not inherently, unlike earth that has it on it’s own right.**_

He says _“nature then, is what we have said, that is, an internal principal of change that belongs to its subject, non-coincidentally. And those things that have a nature are those that have this sort of principle. All these things are substances.”_

Regarding organics he says they have internal principles of change that belong to them insofar as they are what they are. That is, in virtue of their form. Thus Aristotle defends the claim that at least in the case of organisms, it is their form, more than their matter, that is their nature. Therefore form rather than matter is nature.

#### The four causes <a href="#_hlsqakp81t47" id="_hlsqakp81t47"></a>

Aristotle looks to answer:

1. **What is it?** -> This is the _**formal cause**_
2. **What is it made of?** -> This it the _**material cause**_

This question can help us understand the world by understanding for example why a statue doesn’t float -> since it’s made mostly of earth matter

![](<../.gitbook/assets/6 (1).png>)

1. **What made it?** -> the _**efficient cause**_, this is “_the source of the primary principle of change or stability”_ also known as **the maker** or the mover
2. **What is it for?** -> _The **final cause**_. He called it _“the end and the good”_ since he believed that goals (or ends) are good. With this question Aristotle is supposing there is actually a final cause in nature. He explains that for example the goal of a seed is to in the end become a tree. As of this the form and final cause of the tree are the same, Aristotle claims this is ubiquitous among natural things.



**Book 2 (chapter 8)**

_“Nature is one of the causes that are for something”._

This means a being that changes, does that change for a goal. For example a dog has sharp teeth not due to a coincidence of the elements inside of it merging (like pre socratic thought) but rather the dog's nature was aiming at that result (gene theory in 300 BC!).

We can see how pre-socratic people would think this if we see some element transformations as good and due to their inherent properties. For example:

_air goes up -> air is chilled -> transforms into water -> falls into the crops_

But Aristotle claims that this is not the same case as with a dog as he says: “_No result of luck or chance comes to be either always or for the most part”._ That is a dog's teeth are almost always good, rain is not always good for crops. There is a regularity in the dogs form and since this is not coincidental, it must be _for something._
