Plato

### Bio <a href="#_fwmmyoi7t36a" id="_fwmmyoi7t36a"></a>

428/427 or 424/423 – 348/347 BC. Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality.He so-called Neoplatonism of philosophers like Plotinus and Porphyry influenced Saint Augustine and thus Christianity He wrote most of his philosophy in the way of socratic discussions.

#### God <a href="#_v4ierdhxsgi1" id="_v4ierdhxsgi1"></a>

God is understood not as a supernatural force that governs the cosmos from the outside, but as the ultimate principle of the inner workings of the cosmos.

This conception of God is far from the anthropomorphic pictures made fun of by Xenophanes. And in Plato's version, the divine is to be understood in terms of the intelligible order (mathematics and geometry) that is the ultimate reality of the cosmos.

### Euthyphro <a href="#_v99elbzez08e" id="_v99elbzez08e"></a>

**The Euthyphro question**

"Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?"

This raises a fundamental issue regarding the relation between religion and morality

Plato believed that the gods are good and rational and what they love and hate, they love and hate for the right reasons. But this means what is right and wrong is not the attitude of the gods towards it but something else.

The moral Plato intends us to draw is that piety and justice may be pleasing to the gods, but that isn't what makes things pious or just.

### Meno <a href="#_i2bqpj6ghsca" id="_i2bqpj6ghsca"></a>

_What is virtue (Arete)_

In those times virtue was not considered as today, a noble or selfless act, but rather it was more like running for president, looking for a life of power and meaning.

Plato thinks that questions about value, and indeed all philosophical questions, are as objective as mathematics and geometry. He notes a substantial similarity in the way we go about addressing these questions. That is, we look into ourselves.

**Meno's paradox**

1. If I don't know what X is, I don’t know anything about X
2. If I don’t know anything about X, then I can’t inquire successfully into what X is
3. So, If I don’t know what X is, I can't inquire successfully into what X is

Socrates avoids the paradox by distinguishing between true belief and knowledge (We all start with belief)

Knowledge is more definitive than true belief, the latter is more like a supposition

An example of True belief can be seen in a kid that has been raised taught that generosity and altruism is a good thing. But they lack actual knowledge so they can be easily persuaded, for example by the writings of Ayn Rand, which extol the virtues of selfishness. And then they're tempted to abandon the ethical values in which they've been raised.

#### Theory of recollection <a href="#_rv8fyhsjlnv6" id="_rv8fyhsjlnv6"></a>

_“Since the soul is immortal, then, and has been born many times, and has seen both the thing here and the ones in Hades. There is nothing it has not learned. So it is not surprising that it can recollect about virtue and other things, since it knew them before” -_ Socrates Meno

### The apology <a href="#_6emtv1m662zf" id="_6emtv1m662zf"></a>

The charges against Socrates are the following:

1. To inquire about the natural world and therefore being an atheist
2. To convince that a weaker argument is better than a strong one
3. To teach this to the young

Socrates defends himself by explaining that the oracle of delfos said that he was the wisest. Socrates did not believe him (although he knew gods can not lie). To prove him wrong he questioned those who he thought were very wise but learnt that he was not, rather he thought he was and was not aware of his lack of knowledge. In this he saw he was wiser since **he knew he didn’t know.**

He saw **the more reputation they had the more ignorant they were.**

Poets do what they do not out of knowledge but due to natural disposition and inspiration and artisans, technicians (people with specific skills) **they did know their craft but this blinded them and made them think they knew everything**, failing to see their knowledge was limited.

He explains that we should not judge death as something bad since we can’t tell what actually happens, we should like Socrates **to know what we don’t know and not be afraid of it.**

**How to act**

He defends his actions by saying that a **man must act considering if it is just or not and if its proper of a good or vile man no matter the consequences, even if they mean death**

Socrates explains he will continue doing philosophy even if they threaten to murder him since this is his purpose (as commanded by the gods) to **question the idea of athenians** (the real reason behind him being murdered…) and to guide them, and that a man that is just can’t be injured by those who are less. (This brings us to Phedo where the soul can’t be hurt and how a good soul should behave).

He says that he was not a politician because if he would’ve been and had acted worthily and just (as he does) they would’ve killed him long ago.

**A politician can’t be worthy and act justly without getting killed eventually.**

**Conviction**

Socrates doesn’t beg since that would not be deemed of a just man and doesn’t appeal to misericordy since he deduces that if he is judged by that and not justly, he would actually be giving reason to his accusers by making the judges impious like him.

When he’s convicted he only asks for sustain until the sentence is executed, this is to keep in par with what he defended previously and to only give the tribunal the option of freeing or killing him

He explains that he won’t stop inquiring and says:

_“I say that to talk every day about virtue and the other things about which you hear me talking and examining myself and others is the greatest good to man, and that the unexamined life is not worth living, you will believe me still less.”_

**Epilogue**

_“But, gentlemen, it is not hard to escape death; it is much harder to escape wickedness, for that runs faster than death”_. - Apology 39a

Socrates defines 2 possible outcomes for death:

* It’s like sleeping without dreaming forever, which can be a good thing comparing it to the hardships and suffering of life, where all eternity is no more than a single night.
* Our soul moves from this world to another one where other just souls are and where one can keep inquiring and philosophizing.

In the latter case Socrates assumes there’s a good outcome to those who are good, but no argumentation is given to corroborate that, it’s mostly the cultural idea of the time.

In his final speech he makes a final request, he asks for them to treat their sons the way he treated them, ratifying that he was a good influence on the city.

_“When my sons grow up, gentlemen, punish them by troubling them as I have troubled you; if they **seem to you to care for money or anything else more than for virtue, and if they think they amount to something when they do not, rebuke them as I have rebuked you because they do not care for what they ough**t, and think they amount to something when they are worth nothing”_

### Crito <a href="#_2yx4xh695n4o" id="_2yx4xh695n4o"></a>

#### Why shouldn’t Socrates escape prison before he is killed? <a href="#_19u0oxjrtojs" id="_19u0oxjrtojs"></a>

The educated should be taken into consideration and that the opinions of those with subjective biases or beliefs may be disregarded. Likewise, **the popularity of an opinion does not make it valid.**

“**What is worth is not living, but living well** → this is with nobility and justice. **In no case should one act unjust**, even in retribution to one that acted unjustly.” This is why Socrates should not escape (act unjust) even if the conviction is unjust.

**The laws of the state**

Socrates has a conversation with a personification of the laws, here he deduces tha**t “The laws or the State” is like a father to its citizens**, it gives them rights and educates them. And therefore like a father (_see relationship superiority in Greece_) they deserve worship and respect.

If one does not agree one can:

* Leave the state
* Try to persuade the polis to change it.

Since Socrates did neither, he must **remain or else he would destroy the very base on which the state is founded upon**. By accepting his execution, he shows he was wronged by men but not the law which he held.

In the end he refers to how breaking would not only affect him in this life but also in the “next one” as he would be judged as someone who broke them.

O**ne could make an analogy with the Rousseau’s **_**Social Contract**_, but the athenian polis is different in the fact that although **it is a contract that one has with the city, it is not formal**, since it’s mainly giving the citizen the possibility to observe and run the State and if not satisfied **one is free to go without any punishment**. Moreover a citizen **can disent and try to modify what doesn’t seem fair to him.** The homology Plato describes is not a contract between individuals from which the State surges, but rather the individual surges from the state with his tacit acceptance of staying in it .

#### 3 Speeches regarding love <a href="#_d2vpm7a1efxx" id="_d2vpm7a1efxx"></a>

**Lysias**

He argues that in a pederastic relationship, a boy should give his favors to an old man who is not in love rather than one who is in love. The lover, Lysias claims, is mad, and as such is given to unhealthy tendencies that cannot benefit the boy. The non-lover, on the other hand, will offer the boy a stable and educational friendship.



**Socrates First**

Socrates addresses the negative influences of the lover. Love, or _eros_, is a form of madness in which the inborn desire for beauty overwhelms one’s sense of morality and control. Such madness destroys both the soul and body of the boy and will bring him no benefits.

**The Great Speech**



_“The greatest of our goods are originated in madness”_

**4 types of divine madness**

* **Apollo**: Prophecy
* **Dionysus**: Mystic rites
* **Muses**: Poetry _“the poetry of the sane man vanishes into nothingness before that of the inspired mad men” - 245a_
* **Aphrodite**: Love, _“Such madness has been given by the gods for its greatest happiness”_

**Immortal Soul**

A soul is always in motion and as a self-mover has no beginning. A self-mover is itself the source of everything else that moves. So, by the same token, it cannot be destroyed. Bodily objects moved from the outside have no soul, while those that move from within have a soul. Moving from within, all souls are self-movers, and hence their immortality is necessary

**Chariot allegory**

A soul, says Socrates, is like the **"natural union of a team of winged horses and their charioteer".** While the gods have two good horses, **everyone else has a mixture: one is beautiful and good, while the other is neither.**

Following Plato’s tripartite soul from the Republic, the charioteer would be reason, the good horse the spirit and the bad horse the appetite

![](<../.gitbook/assets/0 (2).png>)

Gods go without problems, but **humans are dragged by envy and lack of competence.**

**Any soul that catches sight of any true thing is granted another circuit where it can see more**; eventually, all souls fall back to earth 10 times every 1000 years. Those that have been initiated are put into varying human incarnations, depending on how much they have seen; **from best to worst they incarnate into philosophers**, kings, statesmen to the worst into sophists and tyrants.

If one can reincarnate 3 times as a philosopher then one ascends without waiting 10k.

**Platonic relationship**

When the soul catches a glimpse of a beautiful boy on earth, **it is reminded of the vision of Beauty that it saw beyond the heavens.** The resulting yearning is eros.

At the sight of beauty, the right horse retains a sense of shame and does not move, while the left horse leaps forward in an attempt to jump on the boy. In the end, if one is virtuous, the bad horse is tamed and the lover’s soul finally “follows its boy in reverence”.

**If the man and boy practice modesty and self-control, they will follow the path of philosophy and grow wings after death, a “platonic relationship”.**

if the man and boy let the bad horse slip out of control, they may consummate their relationship, albeit sparingly. In this case their souls will remain wingless after death—but nonetheless will not slip further down, since they will have begun the journey upwards by trying to sprout wings. **In both cases, then, a lover’s friendship brings a boy divine benefits.**

#### Rhetoric <a href="#_lb05czu52qsp" id="_lb05czu52qsp"></a>

To acquire the art of rhetoric, then, one must make systematic divisions between two different kinds of things: one sort, like "iron" and "silver", suggests the same to all listeners; the other sort, such as "good" or "justice", lead people in different directions

(1) Rhetorical art in general is a way of “directing the soul by means of speech” (261a). (2) Rhetoric involves the same art of speaking, be it important or trivial, public or private. (3) Artful speakers can take both sides of an argument by making things seem similar or dissimilar. (4) To know the similar and dissimilar, one must know the truth about each thing one discusses. (5) “Therefore,” Socrates concludes, “the art of a speaker who doesn’t know the truth and chases opinions instead is likely to be a ridiculous thing—not an art at all”

goes on to compare one with only knowledge of these tools to a doctor who knows how to raise and lower a body's temperature but does not know when it is good or bad to do so, stating that one who has simply read a book or came across some potions knows nothing of the art

Suppose someone approached a tragedian, such as Sophocles or Euripides, and claimed that he knew the art of composing all sorts of passages. He may believe that teaching such an art would mean teaching the art of tragedy, but evidently this would not be the case. He knows the “preliminaries of tragedy, but not the art of tragedy itself”

One needs to know how to put these elements together to properly compose and then deliver a good speech on a particular topic for a particular environment.

**Writing**

ory, Thamus responds that its true effects are likely to be the opposite; it is a remedy for reminding, not remembering, he says, with the appearance but not the reality of wisdom. Future generations will hear much without being properly taught, and will appear wise but not be so, making them difficult to get along with

### Fedon <a href="#_5x5kf9w67z6e" id="_5x5kf9w67z6e"></a>

Socrates argues that killing oneself is wrong, insofar we are property of the gods, and it would cause damage to them if we would destroy their property

In this book Socrates defends **why a philosopher should die happy.**

He defines **death as the separation of body and soul**. In life our body is an impediment for knowledge and it gets sick or chases after material pleasures. Our senses can deceive us, and due to this we can’t contemplate the truth (the “Ideas”). Therefore when we die (if we have been pure) we remove the body and we can achieve the truth.

Ceres asks, “_But how do we know that the soul doesn’t die with the body?”_

Socrates will defend this by saying, everything originates in its opposite form “For something to get big it has to be small, or sleep to awaken” The same thing applies from living to dying.

His thesis is as follows:

1. Contraries originate from each other.
2. Death is the opposite of life
3. Therefore death produces life.
4. And based on this t**he soul of the dead must exist somewhere or it could not produce life**

Based on the _theory of recollection,_ Socrates assumes the soul must exist before the body and before we are born in order to have knowledge.

**2 realities**

| Visible                                      | Invisible                             |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Animals, plants...                           | Truth, beauty, unalterable things     |
| We see it with our senses                    | We see it with reason                 |
| Related to the body                          | Related to the soul                   |
| Similar to the mortal world made to be ruled | Similar to the divine made to command |
| It dissolves after death                     | It stays                              |

**The pure soul**

If the soul is pure (spent life doing philosophy) then when separated from the body it doesn’t take anything from the “body” with it and it goes to what is like it, what is divine.

But when the soul is not pure, if we spend our life satisfying bodily pleasures, it will rapidly go back to another body since it’s what it knows and it is tied to that.

**Will the soul eventually die?**

Socrates proposes that no opposite can be contrary to itself, what is big is never small, what is even can never be odd. But there are elements that without being proper opposites like 2 from 3, nonetheless have inside themselves the idea of even (or odd) and do not admit the opposite of what is part of them. For example 3 can never be even, even though it is not contrary to it.

Socrates says _“**not only will opposites not admit their opposites, but nothing which brings an opposite to that which it approaches will ever admit in itself the oppositeness of that which is brought.**”_

Based on this Socrates proposes:

1. The Soul brings life to the body
2. Life is opposite from death
3. Life is part of the Soul (like odd is part of 3)
4. Therefore a soul can’t admit death since it’s contrary to it and
5. The soul is immortal.

### The republic <a href="#_cmwy21xfu4p1" id="_cmwy21xfu4p1"></a>

_**Is justice a virtue?**_

Justice for Plato means: not lying, stealing, cheating, of giving others their due, behaving properly.

Socrates says that this is not a trivial question, _**Is justice a virtue?**_ since it guides what sort of life we should live.

Thrasymachus, a character from book 1 says _"injustice, if it is on a large enough scale, is stronger, freer, and more masterful than justice. It is, he says, profitable and advantageous for oneself"._ So Socrates must prove that this is not actually true.

The following are the usual arguments for why one should be just, but they can be easily debated

* Rewards from a just reputation -> _can be covered up (like Maquiavelos prince would do)_
* Punishments for injustice -> _only if caught_
* Rewards and Punishments in the afterlife -> _you can pay the church to avoid Hell_

**The just city**

Socrates differentiates between political justice (society just or unjust) and also just people.

_**What is justice in a city?**_ We can understand this by figuring out what a city is for.

Socrates says that **there are 3 sorts of jobs in a state:**

* Rulers, who he calls guardians
* Militaries, he calls auxiliaries
* Producers, he calls the money makers.

When each person in a city plays the political role that is due to them given their natural qualifications, that's what justice is in a city, according to Socrates.

_**"Doing one's own work, and not meddling with what is not your own."**_

For Socrates, one class doing the work of another class is the worst possible crime since it would bring down the destruction of the city

Guardians need to be trained since they are young for this, and must pass several tests to prove they are pure and those who pass will be leaders of the city.

In book 3 Plato proposes how to educate the children of the city. He divides them at birth into one of the 3 classes and he explains that with tradition one can have the children of current children to believe in this division as the unique truth.

He explains auxiliaries need to be kept happy and well educated in order to avoid them (who are stronger) from taking the power.

While **guardians must be kept from money, since money corrupts**. Guardians must be told money is impure, he quotes, _“whenever they’ll possess private land, houses, and currency, they’ll be householders and farmers instead of guardians, and they’ll become masters and enemies instead of allies of the other citizens”._

He will later go on to explain how children in the city must be raised (in a sort of Kibbutz way) by having all kids being raised together, they will call themselves brothers and sisters and their elders will all be their parents.

He also explains that women should be educated too, since he shows that women can be equally knowledgeable as a man if thought right (although man is higher)

**The just soul**

Socrates says a person is like a city each of us has the following internal parts.

| **Part of a soul** | **Parts of a city** | **Role**                                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Reason             | Rulers              | Think about what is better and worse, right and wrong, that can take a long term view. |
| Spirit             | Auxiliaries         | Gets angry and emotional, which leads to aggression.                                   |
| Appetite           | Producers           | Desires and wants, likes and dislikes                                                  |

These 3 categories can remind us of Freud's id, superego and ego. (Who was known to have read Plato)

**A properly functioning** **soul (a just soul)** is one without civil war, where Reason guides the other 2 parts, there's no conflict nor regret. The other parts work but in accordance with reason.

While the **unjust soul** of the is in constant conflict, that's why being just should be pursued.

This is why justice is not commensurable like other goods (like wealth or respect) since justice is a necessary condition for them.

To fully understand this position we must see that Socrates thinks the objective good exists, therefore someone who acts wrong but in a controlled manner (like a white collar criminal or someone like Adolf Eichmann) is not actually just since it is not actually Reason which is in control but Appetite.

**Book V**

Socrates explains how education and living should be handled, a short summary:

* Both male and female guardians ought to receive the same education
* Woman guardians will accompany their counterparts
* Human reproduction ought to be regulated by the state and all offspring should be ignorant of their actual biological parents
* Successful warriors will be celebrated and allowed to have more offspring

**Theory of forms**

The physical world is not as real or true as timeless, absolute, unchangeable ideas. According to this theory, ideas in this sense, often capitalized and translated as **"Ideas"** or "Forms", **are the non-physical essences of all things**, **of which objects and matter in the physical world are merely imitations.** Plato speaks of these entities only through the characters (primarily Socrates) of his dialogues who sometimes suggest that these Forms are the only objects of study that can provide knowledge.

The Forms, according to Plato, are the essences of various objects. Forms are the qualities that an object must have to be considered that type of object. For example, there are countless chairs in the world but the Form of “chairness” is at the core of all chairs. Plato held that the **world of Forms is transcendent to our own world,** the world of substances, which is the essential basis of reality.

Though no one has ever seen a perfect circle, nor a perfectly straight line, everyone knows what a circle and a straight line are. Plato uses this as evidence that his Forms are real.

**The divided line**

| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forms         | Knowledge (Understanding)                                | Only Ideas, which are all given existence and truth by the Good itself |
| geometry      | Knowledge (Thought):                                     | Some Ideas, specifically those of Geometry and Number                  |
| Natural world | Opinion (Belief): belief concerning visible things       | visible things                                                         |
| Shadows       | Opinion (Imagination): conjectures concerning likenesses | likenesses of visible things                                           |

Plato states that among the intelligible forms, the form of the Good is like the sun because it is the source of the other Form’s existence and intelligibility.

**Book VIII**

Here Plato explains the pros and cons of various forms of government. He goes over timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny starting from his vision of the perfect ruling (a guardian philosopher-king) he explains how it would break down from one form onto the other.

| **Government**     | **How it is**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | **How it degrades**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

### Timaeus <a href="#_no8khh8mp42v" id="_no8khh8mp42v"></a>

In this dialog Timaeus (An astronomer) gives an opinion regarding the origin of the world, of the kosmos, and concludes with the nature of human beings.

The demiurge is a divine craftsman, looks to the world of the intelligible forms and makes replicas of them in the visible world by imposing order on some primordial soup.

The entire cosmos is a kind of living thing or animal which has both a soul and a body.

**The world soul**

Is a purely rational soul (like the soul in the tripartite), it's constructed based on the ingredients: Being, Same, Different. The demiurge merges them and then structures them according to mathematical principles.

Plato used a mathematical model to define the 4 elements, known at his time: earth, fire, water and air.

He attempted to capture perfection in terms of mathematical and geometrical proportions by using “perfect” triangles as a base to create each form, and then assign each form to an element

**Platonic solids**

What is essential to the story even if the details are inaccurate, is that the structure of the natural world is mathematical and that this is the source of its order, an intelligibility.

Plato says: _“And the ratios of their numbers, motions, and other properties, everywhere God, as far as necessity allowed or gave consent, has exactly perfected, and harmonized in due proportion”_

#### Essay on Socrates Justice <a href="#_zedrkrg24505" id="_zedrkrg24505"></a>

_What Socrates claims justice is (justice in a person) and (b) why he thinks it is never a good idea to be unjust._

What is justice according to Socrates? We can answer this in a very simple manner: balance. But to understand in more depth we need to see what this means for Socrates. He argues a person (or his soul as he would say) is divided in 3 parts.

First there's the appetite, which is the part that desires, wants and craves. It tells us what it likes and dislikes.

Second there's the Spirit, this is the emotional part, it fights but it also stands up to aggression.

Finally and most importantly there's reason, it is the one that thinks about what's good and bad, right and wrong, it plans and analyzes.

Knowing this we can understand Socrates' thought a bit better, he says a soul in balance is a just soul, one where all parts are aligned and working together. We can imagine a person in such balance, as someone that is not greedy since it knows this is wrong and does not let its appetite run free or someone who is compassionate and knows not to fight without cause but just as well knows to stand up against injustice when deemed fit.

We can understand from this how a just person would behave when all parts are kept in check. Contrary to this we can see why being an unjust person would not be a good idea, we can envision someone who can't control himself, who has no self discipline and no balance. Someone who even with all the money or power in the world would still feel angry and resentful, someone without limits for his desires.

We've seen many times how people's desire can have no boundaries and how nothing is enough, wealthy people looking for more and more wealth and the powerful trying to get even more power.

This type of life, unbalanced, is one that not only brings suffering to its own but also to those around it and it can’t be solved by anything external but rather by retrospective thought and trying to balance our inner being.

That's why I believe being just as Socrates meant is so meaningful, especially in our times where the extremes are more exaggerated than ever and the only road to a just world is one made from just people.

#### Speeches regarding love <a href="#_ypvqj5mdg08b" id="_ypvqj5mdg08b"></a>



**Phaedrus**

Phaedrus asserts that both gods and humans regard Love as great and awesome, is widely considered older than almost all the other gods, and has no parents.Chaos was the first thing in existence, followed by Earth and Love.

Love is then primordial and **it’s better than other pleasures since it does not lead to shame.**

No young man could derive greater benefit than from a good lover, and no lover could derive greater benefit than from a young loved one

Phaedrus suggests that an army that consisted solely of lovers and loved ones would be unmatchable, as they would rather die than show cowardice in front of their partner, and they would all strive constantly for greater honor.

For example It was prophesied that Achilles would be killed if he killed Hector, but Achilles still hunted down and killed the man who had killed his lover. He showed supreme courage in accepting death in order to avenge his lover so the gods sent him to the islands of the blessed when he died.

Thus, Phaedrus concludes, Love is the most ancient and most honored of gods, and most capable of ensuring courage and happiness, in this life and the next.

**Pausanias**

There are 2 aphrodites:

* Heavenly Aphrodite, the daughter of Uranus, with whom he associates "Heavenly Love."
* Common Aphrodite, daughter of Zeus and Dione, who is considerably younger than Heavenly Aphrodite, and with whom he associates "Common Love."

**Common Love** is bad because its attraction is undiscriminating, **directed toward bodies rather than toward minds.** People who are motivated by Common Love are equally interested in women and boys, and the less intelligent the better. Heavenly Love is directed only toward males.

Lovers can get away with breaking oaths or to act in ways that would be reprimanded in other scenarios (like begging), because those in love are granted every kind of indulgence, both from humans and from the gods.

Pausanias' central argument, then, is that love is only beneficial when it is directed toward the end of virtue; any other means is wrong, regardless of the consequence. Lovers should seek to improve their loved ones, and loved ones should look to gain wisdom from their lovers. We should note, however, the asymmetrical nature of this relationship, where loved ones are also expected to sexually gratify their lovers in return for the virtue they are taught

**Eryximacos**

Eryximachus concludes that Love is ever-present and all-powerful in our lives, as it is the cause of all self-control, happiness, and justice, and it produces good actions.

While Pausanias expands on Phaedrus' speech by introducing the question of virtue, Eryximachus expands upon Pausanias by extending the realm of Love to cover far more than just interpersonal relationships, but is this “love”?

**Aristophanes**

Aristophanes' speech comes in the form of a myth.

Long ago, he explains, **there were three genders: male, female, and androgynous**, and each **androgynous person was twice what they are now.** That is, they had four hands, four legs, two faces...They were very powerful and vigorous and made threats to attack the gods. The gods did not want to destroy them because they would then forfeit the sacrifices humans made to them, so **Zeus decided to cut each person in two.**

**Because they longed for their original nature, people kept trying to find their other half and reunite with it**. When they found their other half, they would embrace and stay together, not wanting anything else. Those who are interested in members of the opposite sex are halves of formerly androgynous people, while men who like men and women who like women are halves of what were formerly whole males and females.

**"Love" is the name that we give to our desire for wholeness**, to be restored to our original nature.

A certain person is right for us not because that person has certain qualities we find appealing, but because that person's character is similar to ours and resembles our "other half."

**Agathon**

Agathon suggests that Love is the happiest of the gods because he is most beautiful and best. He is beautiful because, contrary to Phaedrus' claim, he is the youngest of the gods

He enumerates the virtues of Love:

* Is just because he is never forced and never uses force:
* Practices moderation, since he can master pleasures and desires
* Is braver even than Ares, since Ares fell in love with Aphrodite and was thus mastered by Love.
* Is wise since he is the inspiration for all other acts of wisdom

The gods only became organized when Love came into being, and were motivated by a love of beauty. **Before that time, they were governed by necessity and did all sorts of horrible things.**

**Socrates**

Socrates first proves by his usual questioning that Agathon actually knows nothing about what love is, since if what love desires is what he loves then necessarily he does not have the object of his desire in his possession and Agathon suggested that the gods are organized through a love of beautiful things. So Love must be love of beauty, which in turn implies that Love itself must be wholly without beauty.

**Diotima**

Socrates continues by restating an account given to him by a woman named Diotima.

Having been convinced that Love is not beautiful or good, Socrates asks Diotima if that means Love is ugly and bad. Diotima argues that not everything must be either one thing or its opposite. For instance, having unjustified true opinions is neither wisdom nor ignorance. Wisdom consists in justified true opinions, but one would hardly call a true opinion ignorant.

They have concluded that **Love is not good and beautiful because he is in need of good and beautiful things.**

Love is neither mortal nor immortal, but is a spirit or daemon, which falls somewhere between being a god and being human. They serve as intermediaries between gods and humans. The gods never communicate directly with humans, but only through the medium of spirits, who are the source of all divination. There are many kinds of spirits, Love being but one. (The daemon that talked to Socrates being another example)

The myth is that _“**Love is the child that Poverty conceived by Resource”**_ As their child Love is always poor, and, far from being sensitive, he is very tough, sleeping out of doors on the rough ground. Like his mother, **he is always in a state of need**, **but** like his father, **he can scheme to get what he wants**. Being neither mortal nor immortal, **Love may shoot into life one day only to die the next and then return to life the following day.**

Love falls between ignorance and wisdom because his father, Resource, is both wise and resourceful, while his mother, Poverty, is neither.

Socrates here sets himself up as the exemplar of Love. Love seeks wisdom, lives simply and is quite poor, he is tough and brave, all these qualities are his.

Socrates calls Love a _**"lover of wisdom"**_ quite literally a philosopher (philia = "love" and sophia = "wisdom").

Diotima dismisses the idea that lovers are in search of their other half, claiming instead that lovers love what is good. We would be willing to have limbs amputated if we thought they were diseased and bad, suggesting that we only want to be attached to what is good.

Diotima's next move is to ask **in what way people pursue love.**

**Sex** is one means of giving birth, and **it is through reproduction that we achieve immortality. This process is divine and therefore beautiful.** All mortal things desire reproduction, and we see this even in birds and animals: they seek partners desperately, and will protect their young with their lives.

Diotima points out that though we talk about the "same person," we are not the same at all throughout our lives. Our body changes, as does our mind and our knowledge so that in old age we are nothing like what we were when we were young. We maintain ourselves in existence by replacing the old with the new, and so reproduction is just one further way of extending our lives.

There are two ways men can become pregnant: in body and mind. Those who are pregnant seek out women with whom they can reproduce and create a bodily heir. Those who are pregnant in mind bring forth not bodies, but wisdom and other virtues. For Socrates (Plato) love can also be expressed through the reproduction of ideas where we become pregnant with the thoughts we have and must give birth to them, sharing them with others.

**The theory of forms**

Diotima shares with Socrates the process to arrive at the Form of Beauty:

1. One begins as a young boy by being **attracted to beautiful bodies,** and to one beautiful body in particular, and produces beautiful discourses with this body.
2. Next we recognize that all **bodies are relatively similar** and that it is foolish to love only one body in particular.
3. We will come to **appreciate the beauty of minds,** and will be able to love those who are beautiful in mind whether or not they are beautiful in body. Recognizing the **beauty in practices and laws,** we will come to **love beauty in general,** not in particular bodies.
4. **The Form of Beauty**: Looking at the different forms of knowledge, we will become a lover of knowledge, loving all sorts of discourses and ideas until he finally settles on one special type of knowledge.



**Alcibiades**

Alcibiades, in his sudden and unexpected appearance, stands as a thinly veiled symbol for the god Dionysus himself.

Alcibiades' speech serves primarily to show that Socrates exemplifies the qualities of the ideal lover alluded to in Diotima's speech.

#### Summary <a href="#_wlagn0ucn299" id="_wlagn0ucn299"></a>

The dialog ends with Socrates trying to suggest that comedy and tragedy can and should be reconciled. This juxtaposes the comic elements of Aristophanes' and Alcibiades' speeches with the more serious (or tragic) elements of Agathon's and Diotima's speeches. **Perhaps Plato is suggesting that philosophy is the ideal synthesis, where comedy and tragedy are brought together in a unified whole.**

Another point of significance is Socrates' behavior the next day**. Neither drunk nor hung-over, Socrates goes about his business as always**. **His attraction to wisdom is so strong that nothing can tire him out or distract him from his pursuit.**
