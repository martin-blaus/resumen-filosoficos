**Book I - On what he learnt from others**

* To run away and not believe charlatanes and impostors
* To avoid all ostentation
* To read with diligence; not to rest satisfied with a light and superficial knowledge

* To live according to the laws of nature
* To look continuously for that which can help my friends

* To be courageous in sickness

* To do my business, whatsoever it be, thoroughly, and without querulousness

**Book II**

We are flesh and our capacity to think.

The universe is governed by a superior being whose escenese is reflected in our spirit.

We have limited time so we must use it to find our soul's tranquility. We must act each day like if it was the last and we will make good decisions.

When we die:

* If there are gods → we will go to them
* If there are no gods → What's the point in living in a world without providence _(with actual evil)_

What is not mine (free will) is neither good nor bad.

Past → **Present** → Future

**Only the present is ours, we don’t own the past nor have secured the future.**

A life of 30 years or 3000 is the same since all that is lost is the present.

**Book III**

_“Thou must hasten therefore; not only because thou art every day nearer unto death than other, but also because that intellective faculty in thee, whereby thou art enabled to know the true nature of things, and to order all thy actions by that knowledge, doth daily waste and decay: or, may fail thee before thou die.”_

**We should not waste our short lives thinking about someone else's business,** unless this is good for society.

If we could find something greater than our divine part (reason) we should dedicate our whole lives to it.

**Our material life is limited to a fleeting moment; the rest of existence does not exist, it is not guaranteed, it is uncertain.** Our reputation is just transmitted to a succession of individuals who will also die, and who will forget us more and more..

**Book IV**

_**“They seek for themselves private retirement places**, such as country villages, the seashore, mountains. But all this thou must know proceeds from simplicity.**It is in thy power to retire into thyself, and to be at rest, and free from all businesses**. He especially who is beforehand provided of such things within, may presently afford **unto him perfect ease and tranquility.** By tranquility I understand a decent orderly disposition and carriage, **free from all confusion** and tumultuousness. **Afford then thyself retiring continually, and thereby refresh and renew thyself.**”_

**Each thought that comes to our head must be examined**, everything should be analyzed and understood its properties and causes. **Don't do anything without reflection, consider** all things as being destined to die.

**Be sober at rest** and neither be a slave or a tyrant to anyone.

Humans were created to stand each other, fighting and hating will be reduced to ashes in the abism of eternity.

**A common law governs us. The world is like a great city.** All things without reason were made to serve those with it.

Since everything came from somewhere, so must intelligence have come from somewhere (the gods). And everything transforms to something, so as bodies decay and become other bodies so will soul will ascend to the heavens

We should ambition:

* To have a spirit of justice
* Perform actions that help society
* To accept the providence.

**Book V**

_**At dawn, when you have trouble getting out of bed, tell yourself: “I am rising to do the work of a human being.** What do I have to complain abo**ut, if I’m going to do what I was born for—**the things I was brought into the world to do? O**r is this what I was created for? To huddle under the blankets and stay warm?**”_

_**Were you born to feel “nice”? Instead of doing things and experiencing them?**_

_But we have to sleep sometime… Agreed. But nature set a limit on that — as it did on eating and drinking. And you’re over the limit. You’ve had more than enough of that. But not working. There’s still more of that to do._

_**You don’t love yourself enough.** For if you did, you’d love your nature too, and what it demands of you. **People who love what they do wear themselves down doing it, they even forget to wash or eat**. Do you have less respect for your own nature than the dancer for the dance, the miser for money or the social climber for status? **When they’re really possessed by what they do, they’d rather stop eating and sleeping than give up practicing their arts. Is not then your labor in the world just as worthy of respect and worth your effort?**_

We must accept what happens to us willingly since:

* It was destined for us
* It contributes to the success of the plan made by the superior being that governs all things.

**Book VI**

**The best way to avenge a bad person is to try not to be like them.**

**If a thing is in the domain of man and in our duty, we can be sure it’s in our reach.**

**Treat with dignity and freedom all animals.**

If someone can prove I acted wrong I should correct myself to not live perpetually in ignorance.

The decision of the gods about me can’t be bad, since we can’t conceive a god without wisdom. Besides they have no reason to act against me since it wouldn't benefit them or the universe.

**“**_**What is not good for the hive is also not good for the bee”**_

**Book VII**

Do not be ashamed of being helped if that helps us accomplish our duties.

**Everything is intertwined forming a divine chain, all things are subordinated to god and this set constitutes the beauty of the universe.**

**We rational beings have been created to cooperate, we must act like a part in everything and in that way we will get true satisfaction.**

Happiness consists of a good spirit and the right reason.

It is the duty of a man to love those who offend us, we must treat them as brothers who act wrong due to ignorance.

Death it’s either a pass to nothing or to a new life.

Pain is either _(Like for Epicurus)_:

* unbearable → kills you fast
* last long in time → we can manage it and the soul replenishes

**Book VIII**

Everytime a **thought** comes to our imagination, **we must consider its nature, its moral character and what truth it holds.**

**Act without negligence**

Don't be diffuse in your conversations

**Don't wander in your thoughts**

**Avoid a tasirturn aspect.**

**Do not consume your life in business**

**Enter into the heart of others and let others enter into yours**

**Book IX**

Why sometimes bad people enjoy pleasures and have lots of things, but good people don’t? We must consider pleasure and pain, life and death like things sent by nature.

2 ways of viewing the world:

1. An intelligence acts over every being individually, so we must submit to its impulses
2. Intelligence put everything in motion and disappeared, therefore everything is atoms and cause and effect. If that is the case we must not let ourselves be guided by random things like the common folk.

**A philosopher must not detach itself from its principles no matter how unpleasant the circumstances**

**Book X - XI**

When someone irritates us, we need to examine ourselves and see which similar faults have we committed and try to help them. Sweetness is an invisible force when used sincerely, straight and without disguise. Even against the most insolent of men.

Men, unlike other beings, grow with adversities.
