# Epictetus

### Epictetus <a href="#_tgtlso6fy1q" id="_tgtlso6fy1q"></a>

(50 – 135 A.D. ) Was a Greek Stoic philosopher. He was born a slave at Hierapolis, Phrygia (present day Pamukkale, Turkey) and lived in Rome until his banishment, when he went to Nicopolis in northwestern Greece for the rest of his life. His teachings were written down and published by his pupil Arrian in his Discourses and Enchiridion.

When we suffer we should not blame someone/something else, but rather ourselves, our opinions.

We should improve by:

1. Blame outside
2. Blame ourselves
3. Accept it

**8**

_**Seek not that the things which happen should happen as you wish; but wish the things which happen to be as they are**, and you will have a tranquil flow of life_

**15**

_“Remember that **you must behave as at a banquet**. Is anything brought round to you? Put out your hand, and t**ake a moderate share.** Does it pass you? Do not stop it. Is it not come yet? **Do not yearn in desire towards it, but wait till it reaches you**. So with regard to children , wife, office, riches; and you will **some time or other be worthy to feast with the gods.** And if you do not so much as take the things which are set before you, but are able even to forego them, then you will not only be worthy to feast with the gods, but to rule with them also.”_

**16**

We should accompany others in their feelings, even cry with them. But we should not do it inside ourselves.

**28**

We should not let ourselves be offended by those who insult us, since this is external to us.

**37**

We should only play a role that we have the capacity to do, if not we will fail at that and at what we could’ve become.

**51**

In philosophy there are 3 steps:

1. Define principles: _“Do not lie”_
2. Prove these principles: _“Why shouldn’t we lie?”_
3. Question the demonstrations of step 2: _“What is true?”, “What is a contradiction?”..._

**52**

Maxims to hold closely:

_“But whoso nobly yields unto necessity, We hold him wise, and skill'd in things divine.“_

_“O Crito, if so it pleases the gods, so let it be;”_

_“Anytus and Meletus are able indeed to kill me, but they cannot harm me. “_

**Book I**

**If we chain ourselves to many objects**, like the body, a brother, the house, our children, **we see us oppressed and dragged by them.**

**Free will**

We must organize by ourselves what depends on us in the best possible way and **accept the rest as what comes**, how the divinity intended.

I could be killed or robbed, **but not even god can beat my free will,** **so how I react to these things is entirely up to me. The divinity granted us free will** in order to **be able to bear everything that happens** without being depressed or broken by it.

It is hard circumstances which show what men are, the divinity matches us with what we should be able to handle although not a simple challenge

Everyone has a price, that price is up to each one of us. Some people decide to pay it in order to achieve certain things (sacrifice time and pain for a gold medal) some don't.

Humans are divided in 2, the **body** which is common with animals, and **reason** which is common with the gods. Most people tend more to the mortal side than the divine.

**Moral behavior** is guided by 3 things:

* **Desire**: they press and compel us.
* **Choice**
* **Assent**: To agree or not with something

When something bad happens we can complain out loud, but to ourselves we should not,

**“what is worth in life is** _**to study how a man can rid his life of lamentation and groaning”**_

If there a situation we don’t like, we should just leave, not complain

**The divinity made things in order for them to be used.** If it would’ve created colors but there was no one with the ability to see them it would be pointless. **This shows the work of a craftsman** (deism) **who engineered the world, not random chance.**

**Humans were introduced to this world** **by god** not only as a spectator, but an **interpreter**. We must not end where irrational animals do, but rather to begin where they begin, and **to end where nature ends in us, in contemplation and understanding**, in a way of life conformable to nature.\\

We are all sons of god and therefore equals, even slaves.

**Suicide**

Epictetus answer to those who don’t want to live anymore:

_"Friends, wait for God; when He shall give the signal and release you from this service, then go to Him; but for the present endure to dwell in this place where He has put you: short indeed is this time of your dwelling here, and easy to bear for those who are so disposed: for what tyrant or what thief, or what courts of justice, are formidable to those who have thus considered as things of no value the body and the possessions of the body? Wait then, do not depart without a reason." -_ Discourses, IX

If one has **greatness of soul** then one holds the **greatest possession** and doesn’t need from other earthly things, but those who are coward and vile need will request it and won't’ understand how empty they are and that no one is miserable thought the means of other

One is a prisoner when being held against its will, but **if we can be comfortable where we are we wont be prisoners** (like Socrates in jail)

With respect to your brothers, and your body, and possessions, and death and life, the gods have left us free from responsibility. **We are only responsible for that which is in our power,** the proper use of appearances (rationalization). We should not bother ourselves regarding what we are not responsible for since there is no point.

We can either avoid admiring the things that are not in our control like possessions or loved ones and then we won't be hurt if we lose them, or we can avoid having things that our neighbors don't have to avoid causing temptation to them.

**Bad people**

We should not get angry with thieves and liars since **they act like that because they don't know better**. To kill someone who can’t distinguish right from wrong is like killing a blind man because he can’t see. **Those people are to be educated and if it can’t be helped do not hate him but pity him.**

When people assent to something which is not true is not because they wanted to but because they didn’t know it was false. Like Plato and Aristotle said, **men act wrongly because they are not aware of it.**

Precognitions are common to all men. We all have certain knowledge (like justice is beautiful) but contradictions arise when trying to apply this to particular scenarios. Since we add to this natural precognition unjustified opinions.

For this we have **education which should teach how to adapt the natural precognitions to the particular things** conformably to nature; and then to distinguish what depends on our free will and what not. **So the good will be in those things that depend on us. And that which is not up to us is neither good or bad, it just is.**

**What is free by nature can’t be disturbed by anything else besides itself.** A tyrant can own our corpse but not our soul.

**We should be like a stone,** when a stone is cursed it doesn’t not flinch he who curses gets nothing. **When we respond we aid the attacker and we become like them.**

**Suffering is to want something and for it not to happen**. When we want to change what happens outside of us and fail we get angry, anxious. **We should instead want the events to happen as they do.**

**Book 2**

We need to be prudent and cautious with what depends on us but to have courage and trust with what is not.

**We should not fear death itself, we can’t control it**. But we should die with honor since we can control that, like Socrates.

**Wholism**

“_What are you? A man. If you consider yourself as detached from other men, it is according to nature to live to old age, to be rich, to be healthy. But **if you consider yourself as a man and a part of a certain whole**, it is for the sake of that whole that at one time you should be sick, at another time take a voyage and run into danger, and at another time be in want, and, in some cases, die prematurely. Why are you troubled? Do you not know, that as a foot is no longer a foot if it is detached from the body, **so you are no longer a man if you are separated from other men. For what is a man? A part of a state, of that first which consists of Gods and of men; then of that which is called next to it, which is a small image of the universal state.**”_

Stoicism is clearly anthropomorphic, for Epictetus animals were created to serve man. They are not primordial like us since they lack divinity (reason).

**Philosophy**

**Its principle is to inquire over what is right and try to create rules, as other sciences have, to understand in every scenario how to act.**

We should not only be happy with learning, **we should also practice it.**

The majority of men live their life without contemplation, few wonder the world is trying to understand it. Those may be criticized by the many who don’t know how to live (like Socrates explains Crito)

**Book 3**

**To be beautiful we must focus on our virtue, what is extraordinary about us is the rational part.**

**This is our free will.** Our body, our hair was molded by god and we should leave it be.

We should behave properly no matter how others do to me. _“For this is my own business: that belongs to another; no man can prevent this, the other thing can be hindered.“_

We should be critical of every representation we make, we should not just grab the first impression as true but to inspect it. (An examined life)

**Solitude**

_“For as Zeus dwells with himself, and is tranquil by himself, and thinks of his own administration and of its nature, and is employed in thoughts suitable to himself; so ought **we also to be able to talk with ourselves, not to feel the want of others also, not to be unprovided with the means of passing our time**; to observe the divine administration and the relation of ourselves to everything else; to consider how we formerly were affected toward things that happen and how at present; what are still the things which give us pain; how these also can be cured and how removed; if any things require improvement, to improve them according to reason” -_ XIII

**Book 4**

No one wants to live deceived, being unfair and vile, therefore no evil person lives as they would want to nor are they free.

Even if we are not actual slaves, we are still slaves to someone, for example to someone we love, even a king. **If we love wealth, honor... then we are slaves to those who have power over that.**

**We need to learn how to live**, the way we learn how to write, **in order to do it right.**

Not only wanting external things like wealth, and power makes us bad. Also wanting calm and relaxation. **Anything outside of us makes us slaves to our side.**

**We should only do things in order to achieve serenity. If** we watch TV or read for knowledge or for pleasure, this makes us simple and miserable men.
