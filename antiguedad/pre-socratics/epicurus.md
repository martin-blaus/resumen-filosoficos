### Epicurus <a href="#_3idmiav9cvyw" id="_3idmiav9cvyw"></a>

### Bio <a href="#_s7c6rqhz9nhm" id="_s7c6rqhz9nhm"></a>

He was born in 342 b.C. He follows Democritus and believes the atoms and the voids to be the ultimate constituents of the natural world, he was a hedonistic philosopher.

It's interesting to analyze how epicurean philosophy is antagonistic of christianism, the latter one putting all goods in life in the afterlife while Epicurus proposes the opposite, living relaxed and in the nothingness of death.

He was an atomic materialist, following in the steps of Democritus. His materialism led him to a general attack on superstition and divine intervention.

We could define his philosophy:

* **Enlightened**: be smart about how to achieve pleasures, we are simple creatures
* **Egoistic**: think in oneself foremost but with retribution to others
* **Hedonist:** seek pleasures but simple ones

**Gods**

Epicurus believes there are anthropomorphic gods since all humans have a preconception of it but they are not required for the natural phenomena to occur.

#### Physics <a href="#_eehpdtmlayj4" id="_eehpdtmlayj4"></a>

**The entire universe consisted of two things: matter and void.**

Matter is made up of atoms, which are tiny bodies that have only the unchanging qualities of shape, size, and weight.

The soul is also made of atoms, and dies with the body.

**The swerve**

If everything is atoms and they are always going downwards they would be like parallel rain and no atom would ever touch another. So Epicurus said that atoms sometimes swerve slightly producing the interactions.

To explain how nature works, unlike Plato who proposed a Demiurge or Aristotle who said nature works through goal directed processes, Epicurus instead invokes a theory of **infinite worlds**, explaining that this world is just one of many possibilities that could arise given the basic atomic structure and motions. There is **no requirement for a god** to enact this movement or phenomena.

If one takes **Democritus' thought on the atoms it inevitably leads to determinism**, since every action has a cause, **Epicurus swerve solves this, since these interactions are random and therefore allow free will.** Pretty much what Heisenberg and quantum physics would prove millennia later, if this leads to free will is another question.

**Sensations**

**Every object is continually emitting particles from itself, called films, that would then interact with the observer**. All sensations, such as sight, smell, or sound, relied on these particles. While **the atoms that were emitted did not have the qualities that the senses were perceiving**, so we can perceive them wrong, the manner in which they were emitted caused the observer to experience those sensations.

#### Pleasures <a href="#_bo5oc3c4dqfj" id="_bo5oc3c4dqfj"></a>

_“When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do by some through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. **By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul**. **It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts** and of revelry, **not by sexual lust,** nor the enjoyment of fish and other delicacies of a luxurious table, **which produce a pleasant life**; **it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance**, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.”_ — Epicurus, "Letter to Menoeceus”

Epicurus distinguished between two main types of pleasure:

* **Body**: Eating, Sleeping, Sex… Only exists while we are enjoying them
* **Mind:** Joy, lack of fear. They exist both in the past and future since we can remember or expect them.

**And furthermore in:**

* **Moving:** Occur when one is in the process of satisfying a desire and involves an active titillation of the senses. After one's desires have been satisfied (e.g. after drinking a cup of coffee), the pleasure quickly goes away and the suffering of wanting to fulfill the desire again returns.
* **Static:** Being in a state without pain, of the body (_aponia_) like not being thirsty, or of the mind (_ataraxia)_ like not being anxious.

This is why for Epicurus, **static pleasures are the best** pleasures because moving pleasures are always bound up with pain.

The pleasure of just being is the one we need to understand.

#### Ataraxia <a href="#_te0md2erjuyl" id="_te0md2erjuyl"></a>

Epicurus believed the goal of life was _**Ataraxia,**_** this is “freedom from distress”** a state in which the person is completely free from all pain or suffering and that this should be our goal in life.

**This view of hedonism is** different from our modern belief, it’s **not to seek pleasure but to avoid pain**

#### Tetrapharmakos (“four-part remedy”) <a href="#_ifotaj8w0f2d" id="_ifotaj8w0f2d"></a>

They are recommendations to avoid anxiety, to be in _ataraxia_

1. Don't fear god
2. Don't worry about death
3. What is good is easy to get
4. What is terrible is easy to endure (_Extreme pain does not last long and can be controlled_)



**Fear of Gods**

Gods are perfectly happy which means they live in constant state of _ataraxia,_ this means **they don't get angry,** **annoyed so they have no reason to cause trouble** (earthquakes, plagues)

**Fear of Death**

**Death is nothing to us.** Since good and bad consists in sense experience, and death is the privation of this therefore death is neither good or bad.

One can argue that bad can come without the need of a sense experience (like being lied to but not aware of it). To avoid this we can change the argument a bit.

1. Nothing good or bad happens to us unless we exists
2. We don’t exist when we are dead
3. So, death is nothing good or bad for us.
4. Therefore we should not fear death _-> this is Epicurus point_

**What is good is easy to get**

Sustenance and shelter, these things can be acquired by anyone with minimal effort, regardless of wealth. But looking for unnecessary pleasures can lead us to needless anxiety and limits our chances of satisfaction and happiness

**What is terrible is easy to endure**

_“We hold the greatest pleasure to be that which is perceived when all pain is removed”_

Epicurus distinguishes between 2 kinds of pains:

* **Bodily pain:** Hunger, thirst, etc..
* **Mental pain:** Fear, Anxiety, etc… This has the greatest impact in our experience since we can endure bodily pain (for example hunger) if we know we will soon have something to eat.

Epicurus explains that **we should not worry about things we can’t control,** since it would detain us from achieving _ataraxia_. So we need to get rid of our desires for them (something that is painful when it is unsatisfied).

**Having a positive mental state towards pain can help** and he shows for example that the stronger the pain, the shorter it lasts.

He says (a very buddhist thing to say) _"**misfortunes must be cured by a sense of gratitude** for what has been and the knowledge that what has passed cannot be undone”._ Meaning we can handle current pain by reflecting on the good things that have happened to us in the past.

To summarize, his view on pain is that we can endure it by managing the mental component of our pain; we should think “It will be over soon” or “I can bear it”, and focus our attention on pleasant memories or expectations. So our total experience (mental and bodily pleasure and pain) will not be on balance painful.

And if the pain is too strong, we will surely die very soon so better see point 1 of the Tetrapharmakos.

#### Desires <a href="#_dffdj62mrd3o" id="_dffdj62mrd3o"></a>

They can be divided in 3:

* **Natural and necessary:** To eat, to drink,to have shelter or clothing...
* **Natural and** **unnecessary**: To eat a specific meal or to wear Prada. These desires fail to substantially increase a person's happiness, and at the same time require effort to obtain and are desired by people due to false beliefs that they are actually necessary
* **Unnatural and unnecessary**: neither innate to humans nor required for happiness or health; they are also limitless and can never be fulfilled. Desires of wealth or fame

The more easily satisfied our desires are, the less we worry about whether we will be able to satisfy them. Therefore to achieve ataraxia it is better to reduce our desires in order to make them achievable.

**We need to avoid getting attached to things we don’t need.**

We should **not aim for austerity** but rather **to accept the conditions we have,** to limit our desires and to enjoy that which we have.

We can **of course enjoy improvements** on our condition (like getting promoted to first class in a flight) but **we should be able to enjoy the situation we are in** _(I can relate this to Camus point of view on experiences)_

#### Justice <a href="#_h4q0pdypdxz7" id="_h4q0pdypdxz7"></a>

He developed the **notion of justice as a social contract.** He defined justice as **an agreement made by people not to harm each other.** The point of living in a society with laws and punishments is to be protected from harm so that one is free to pursue happiness.

Because of this, **laws that do not contribute to promoting human happiness are not just.**

He gave his own unique version of the ethic of reciprocity, which differs from other formulations by emphasizing minimizing harm and maximizing happiness for oneself and others.

_"It is impossible to live a pleasant life without living wisely and well and justly (_to prevent a person from harming or being harmed_) and it is impossible to live wisely and well and justly without living a pleasant life.”_

#### Politics <a href="#_36sfioewwv6n" id="_36sfioewwv6n"></a>

**No one is inherently of higher value or meant to dominate another**. (Unlike Aristotle's point of view) That is because there is no metaphysical basis for superiority, **all people are made of the same atomic material and are thus naturally equal.**

#### Epistemology <a href="#_2qjkjhiqw08i" id="_2qjkjhiqw08i"></a>

**It’s empirical, they believed that all sense perceptions were true,** and that errors arise in how we judge those perceptions.When we form judgments about things, they can be verified and corrected through further sensory information. Like seeing a straw bent in water (due to reflection), but when using touch realizing it’s not broken.

**Unlike Plato’s theory of recollection,** Epicurus says that preconceptions are concepts that **are** **formed in a person's mind through sensory input over time,** like what someone's idea of a horse is. When the word that relates to the preconception is used, **these preconceptions are summoned up by the mind into the person's thoughts.**
