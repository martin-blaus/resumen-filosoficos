# Pre socratics

### Pre socratics <a href="#_lvz9d3adjy2v" id="_lvz9d3adjy2v"></a>

In this era sciences like astronomy where considered philosophy, philosophers were concerned about the natural order, they were called naturalists. Aristotle called them physiologos (which is the root for the modern term Physics)

### Milesians <a href="#_ndtb7qu27ea5" id="_ndtb7qu27ea5"></a>

They claim that 4 elements make everything: Fire, water, air and earth. Each pre-socratic thought a different element was the principal one.

They did not use the divine to explain the natural phenomena

Celestial and terrestrial phenomena can be explained with the same principles, they did not believe in a world without god, rather they identified their primal element as a god.

#### Thales <a href="#_puh7a2jcwets" id="_puh7a2jcwets"></a>

Considered the first philosopher. He was an astronomer and proposed a theory on magnetism

For him the basic material was water, earth floats on water like a piece of wood

#### Anaximander <a href="#_l4uos572ovi6" id="_l4uos572ovi6"></a>

His primordial element is a kind of indeterminate stuff. Besides that he says the opposites hot and cold are separated. And these, in turn, give rise to the elements, earth, air, fire, and water

#### Anaximenes <a href="#_vpghettmet9b" id="_vpghettmet9b"></a>

For him the material principle is Air, earth is a flat disc of compressed air riding on top of gaseous air

#### Xenophanes <a href="#_x0zxornmouz8" id="_x0zxornmouz8"></a>

He says that the traditional conceptions of the gods are mistaken, the anthropomorphic picture of gods is based on our own limited perspective. (For every different person god looks like themselves… _like jesus for western culture_)

### Heraclitus <a href="#_y2ggbhgabtm" id="_y2ggbhgabtm"></a>

His most important argument was the LOGOS and fire was the primordial element.

He claims that all things are one, this is his LOGOS, this is not to say there is no multiplicity in the world but rather to insist there is an underlying order to that multiplicity which is not obvious and most people fail to see.

#### Change <a href="#_m1cv7xn52zm2" id="_m1cv7xn52zm2"></a>

He thought that change is constant, that we live in a world of change.

He said “Upon those who step into the same rivers different and again different waters flow.” - meaning the river itself remains the same but the waters inside of it change constantly

### Parmenides <a href="#_9b6h9zqz0z36" id="_9b6h9zqz0z36"></a>

He proposes to stop using the _“is not”_ to reason, and always use the _“is”_

1. I think there is no Loch Ness MOnster
2. So, I am thinking about the monster
3. So, there _is_ a monster

_(The error is assuming that anything we think of is actually true)_

#### Against change <a href="#_1123xz7oa2ux" id="_1123xz7oa2ux"></a>

He argued the notion of change is incoherent (since is thinking about what “is not”)

His argument goes as follows:

1. If something comes to be, it comes to be from what is not
2. We cannot think about what is not
3. So, change is unthinkable

For example:

* From child to adult we can say

| Before           | After        |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| The adult is not | The adult is |

* And we can say that in 100 years

| Before       | After            |
| ------------ | ---------------- |
| The adult is | The adult is not |

Following that “is not” is unthinkable then change is not possible.

**Answers**

_**Empedocles answered**_ this by differentiating between the ‘is of existence’ and the ‘predicative is’. For example if we say an apple turns red as it ripens, previously (before) it was not red, and now it is red, so it came to be from what is not.

This is not to say before the apple did not exist, it was not red, but it still exists.

In short: _“The predicative sense of ‘is not’ does not necessitate that something ‘is not’ in the existential sense.”_

_**Fallacy of Equivocation**_

Parmenides mistakes the two different senses of “is not”

### Other philosophers <a href="#_rp3qbv444ix4" id="_rp3qbv444ix4"></a>

#### Democritus and Leucippus <a href="#_phhpsz9c4zql" id="_phhpsz9c4zql"></a>

They maintain that the ultimate constituents of everything in the cosmos are atoms and the void.

The full is _the atom_, and the empty is _the void_

#### Anaxagoras <a href="#_xe9kosi9uze7" id="_xe9kosi9uze7"></a>

#### Sophists <a href="#_klft6xl0wur5" id="_klft6xl0wur5"></a>

Meant to be a wise person or intellectual. They charged a fee for instructing and they focused on winning the argument, not on the truth.

_Why was socrates not a sophist?_

For plato Socrates uses arguments for a serious purpose. To get at the truth, not to score points in a debate, or to impress an audience of onlookers. That is how genuine philosophy is different from mere rhetoric or sophistry. And it’s due to this distinction made by Plato that today sophistry is a term for misleading or specious argumentation
