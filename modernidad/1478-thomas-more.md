(1478 - 1535) Sir Thomas More, venerated in the Catholic Church as Saint Thomas More, was an English lawyer, social philosopher, author, statesman, and noted Renaissance humanist. He was also a chancellor to Henry VIII, and Lord High Chancellor of England from October 1529 to May 1532.

The Soviet Union in the early twentieth century honoured him for the purportedly communist attitude toward property rights in Utopia.

After refusing to take the Oath of Supremacy, he was convicted of treason and executed. On his execution, he was reported to have said: "I die the King's good servant, and God's first".

Kings are more interested in conquest than in ruling what they already have, they get surrounded by those who think like them.

**On thieves**

At the time stealing was punishable by death

Killing thieves is as a method unjust, too extreme and not effective to dissuade. If stealing is the only way to get food, not even killing will keep people from robbing.

It would be much more adequate to provide possible thieves with the means of life. Like a teacher who instead of expelling a student teaches to him.

Also men that come from war are unprepared for work in peace or injured and they are not able to work.

Many noblemen live from the work of others like drones who feed from higher rent, they live comfortable lives without doing any good for society and even cause damage by taking the jobs of others (by buying their land) and creating monopolies.

They absorb all the land like a malign tumor expelling the population, deceiving them and dispossessing their property. Is no wonder that people without money and with nowhere to apply their skills, will resolve to steal.

_**“They create thieves and then convict them stealing”**_

The correct action should be to punish thieves with forced community work or private work but with very low pay. They should work under the wip but with proper conditions.

**The state should:**

* Make whoever destroys a farm or a village should rebuild it
* Prevent oligopolies and monopolies
* Reduce unemployment
* Provide useful and honest work where needed.

**On kings**

_“I don't see how it can be in the public interest to prepare for war, which you needn't have unless you want to, when peace is infinitely more important”_

_**“Kings were crowned for the benefit of the people, not their own”**_

Keeping the people poor to preserve peace is counterproductive, since it will just encourage rebellion..

If a king is hated they need to be controlled by violence, expropriation or extortion.

Ruling of the poor and being the only rich, more than a king is a prison guard.

There is no place for a philosopher near a king (like Plato suggested) since they won’t go against their own prejudice nor interest.

**On private property**

_“I must freely own that **as long as there is any property, and while money is the standard of all other things, I cannot think that a nation can be governed either justly or happily**: not justly, because the best things will fall to the share of the worst men; nor happily, because all things will be divided among a few (and even these are not in all respects happy), the rest being left to be absolutely miserable.\[...] **so many other nations that are still making new laws, and yet can never bring their constitution to a right regulation;** where, notwithstanding every one has his property, yet all the laws that they can invent have not the power either to obtain or preserve it, or even to enable men certainly to distinguish what is their own from what is another's, of which the many lawsuits that every day break out, and are eternally depending, give too plain a demonstration \[...] setting all upon a level was the only way to make a nation happy; which cannot be obtained so long as there is property, for when every man draws to himself all that he can compass, by one title or another, it must needs follow that, how plentiful soever a nation may be, **yet a few dividing the wealth of it among themselves, the rest must fall into indigence.** So that there will be two sorts of people among them, who deserve that their fortunes should be interchanged-**-the former useless, but wicked and ravenous; and the latter, who by their constant industry serve the public more than themselves,** sincere and modest men--from whence I am persuaded that till property is taken away**, there can be no equitable or just distribution of things, nor can the world be happily governed;** for as long as that is maintaine**d, the greatest and the far best part of mankind, will be still oppressed with a load of cares and anxieties.** \[...] for if laws were made to determine at how great an extent in soil, and at how much money, every man must stop \[...] **These laws, I say, might have such effect as good diet** and care might have on a sick man whose recovery is desperate; they might allay and mitigate the disease, **but it could never be quite healed, nor the body politic be brought again to a good habit as long as property remains**; and it will fall out, as in a complication of diseases, that by applying a remedy to one sore you will provoke another, and that which removes the one ill symptom produces others, while the strengthening one part of the body weakens the rest”_

**Utopia**

* The island contains 54 cities, all almost identical
* Each city has not more than 6000 households,
* Each family consists of between 10 and 16 adults.
* Women and children in the house are subjected to the man.
* Thirty households are grouped together and elect a phylarchus ("ruler of a tribe")
* Every ten phylarchus have an elected proto-phylarchus ruling over them.
* The 200 phylarchus of a city elect a Prince (a Mayor) in a secret ballot
* The Prince stays for life unless he is deposed or removed for suspicion of tyranny.
* There are also no locks on the doors of the houses, and the houses are rotated between the citizens every ten years.
* Agriculture is taught to every person and they must be farmers for two years at a time, with women doing the same work as men.
* Every citizen must learn at least one essential trade from their father or switch to a different father if they want to do something else. Everyone gets primary education.
* All people wear the same types of simple clothes and there are no dressmakers making fine apparel.
* All able-bodied citizens must work; phylarchus control this
* People only have to work six hours a day.
* There are public lessons to improve one’s trade.
* Some who are talented study instead of working (if they don’t succeed they go back to work) this will become phylarchus, proto-phylarchus, princes and priest
* Every need is supplied by warehouses in the city, free of charge.
* Slaves are in charge of the hard labor, they are convicts or prisoners of war.
* There are no pubs or brothels, everyone watches everyone to force virtuosity.
* What they don’t need they sell or give away
* Money doesn’t exist, they demonize gold and jewelry by making slaves and kids wear and using it in bathrooms.
* Eutanasia if approved by officials is allowed and encouraged for those in pain. Suicide is punished.
* They use the scientific method to improve agriculture and increase life expectancy.
* Their code (laws) is short and simple so anyone can understand it and there is no need for lawyers (who lie and take advantage of the system) everyone carries their own trial.

Bertrand Russell called this Utopia a very boring place to live in.

**Ethics**

They are hedonists, the search for leisure is licit and it’s encouraged by nature. To act according to nature is virtuous and pleasurable. Nature wants us to help each other to enjoy life. To deprive someone from a pleasure to get it ourselves is wrong; we must strive for the opposite which is an act of humanity and elevates the spirit.

We are compelled by reason to seek pleasure (_like Aristotle said)_ but we need to avoid:

* Harming others
* Interfere with the elevated pleasures
* Avoid nasty consequences

Contemplating nature, the work of god, is a way to please him since we are the only ones capable of admiring his work.

They avoid _**illusory pleasures**_, like nobility, jewelry, greed. They consider hunting a terrible thing, tearing apart a helpless animal for fun should provoke piety not pleasure.

**Pleasures (very **_**epicurean)**_**:**

* **Mental**:
  * To contemplate the truth, to understand.
  * Good memories
  * Expectation of the future
* **Physical**:
  * Passive (Health): it is the base for other physical pleasures
  * Active: Eating, Sleeping

**Family**

* Sex outside of marriage is punishable with celibacy.
* The bride is shown naked to the groom, in order for him to inspect the _merchandise_
* Divorce is approved but discouraged and only when the couple is incompatible and both have found better partners.



**War**

* They use mercenaries
* They try to win without fighting (by making other fight or overturning governments)
* Wifes can fight next to their husbands
* They don’t seek conquest, on victory they retreat and don't take the spoils
* They try to avoid fighting in their own island

**Religion**

Most believe in a unique god, unknown, eternal, infinite, inexplicable and beyond human understanding. An active force identical to nature.

It is very similar to christianity and the communism prescribed by Jesus.

They believe in the immortal soul created by god, in reward or punishment in the after life according to the material life behaviour. If one did not accept this view, it was like degrading their immortal soul to a simple animal, these people were despised (but not punished) and they could not have office work since they would always be seeking their self benefit without a reason to be good. Utopians have religious tolerance (unlike Thomas More who burn several heretics in the stake).

Women could be priests and priests could marry.

**The most religious**

Some utopians spend their life doing good deeds in order to gain happiness after death.\
They are divided in 2 sects:

* **Extreme**: they are celibate, vegan and have only expectations for the next life. They justify themselves on the basis of religion, not reason
* **Moderate**: They approve marriage and understand that pleasure is part of life .

**On current governments**

Below follows an amazing extract on how the rich take advantage of the poor, how the state protects them by laws they make for themselves and the corruption both private and public.

How the non essential people earn millions while the essential die in poverty. How the

How one could feed everyone if it was not for the greed of those who have the goods but prefer to store it.

_**“What justice is there in this**: that a nobleman, a goldsmith, a banker, or any other man, that either does nothing at all, or, at best, is employed in **things that are of no use to the public**_**, **_**should live in great luxury and splendour** upon what is so ill acquired, **and a mean man**, a carter, a smith, or a ploughman, **hat works harder even than the beasts themselves**, **and is employed in labours so necessary,** th**at no commonwealth could hold out a year without them, can only earn so poor a livelihood and must lead so miserable a life,** that the condition of the beasts is much better than theirs? For as the beasts do not work so constantly, so they feed almost as well, and with more pleasure, and have no anxiety about what is to come, **whilst these men are depressed** by a barren and fruitless employment, **and tormented with the apprehensions of want in their old age;**_ _**since** that which they get by their daily labour does but maintain them at present, and is consumed as fast as it comes in, **there is no overplus left to lay up for old age**._

_**Is not that government both unjust and ungrateful, that is so prodigal of its favours to those that are called gentlemen,** or goldsmiths, or such others who are idle, or live either by flattery or by contriving the arts of vain pleasure, **and, on the other hand, takes no care of those of a meaner sort, such as ploughmen, colliers, and smiths, without whom it could not subsist?** But after the public has reaped all the advantage of their service, and they come to be oppressed with age, sickness, and want, all their labours and the good they have done is forgotten, and all the recompense given them is that they are left to die in great misery. **The richer sort are often endeavouring to bring the hire of labourers lower,** not only by their fraudulent practices, but **by the laws which they procure to be made to that effect,** so that though it is a thing most unjust in itself to give such small rewards to those who deserve so well of the public, **yet they have given those hardships the name and colour of justice, by procuring laws to be made for regulating them.**_

_“I can have no other notion of all the other governments that I see or know, than **that they are a conspiracy of the rich, who, on pretence of managing the public, only pursue their private ends, and devise all the ways and arts they can find out**; **first, that they may, without danger, preserve all that they have so ill-acquired, and then, that they may engage the poor to toil and labour for them at as low rates as possible, and oppress them as much as they please**; and if they can but prevail to get these contrivances established by the show of public authority, which is considered as the representative of the whole people, then they are accounted laws \[...]_

_And **who does not see that the frauds, thefts,, murders, treacheries**... which are, indeed, rather punished than restrained by the seventies of law, **would all fall off, if money were not any more valued by the world**? Men’s fears, solicitudes, cares, labours, and watchings would all perish in the same moment with the value of money; even poverty itself, for the relief of which money seems most necessary, would fall. \[If resources] had been distributed among the poor, none would have felt the terrible effects of that scarcity: so easy a thing would it be to supply all the necessities of life, **if that blessed thing called money, which is pretended to be invented for procuring them was not really the only thing that obstructed their being procured!**_

_I do not doubt but rich men are sensible of this, and that they well know how much greater happiness it is to want nothing necessary, than to abound in many superfluities; and to be rescued out of so much misery, than to abound with so much wealth._

_**Pride thinks its own happiness shines the brightest, by comparing it with the misfortunes of other persons**; that by displaying its own wealth they may feel their poverty the more sensibly.”_

**The book ends with More admitting Utopia is not likely to happen in the real world**

_“However, there are many things in the commonwealth of Utopia that I rather wish, than hope, to see followed in our governments.”_
