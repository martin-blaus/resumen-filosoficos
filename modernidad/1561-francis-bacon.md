### Bio <a href="#_l9qmds3hccc4" id="_l9qmds3hccc4"></a>

(1561 - 1626) Also known as Lord Verulam, was an English philosopher and statesman who served as Attorney General and as Lord Chancellor of England. His works are credited with **developing the scientific method** and remained influential through the scientific revolution. **Bacon has been called the father of empiricism**

His works argued for the possibility of scientific knowledge based only upon inductive reasoning and careful observation of events in nature. Most importantly, **he argued science could be achieved by use of a sceptical and methodical approach whereby scientists aim to avoid misleading themselves**. Although his most specific proposals about such a method, the Baconian method, did not have a long-lasting influence, the general idea of the importance and possibility of a sceptical methodology makes Bacon the father of the scientific method.

“He takes up Democritus mechanism and passes is to Hobbes, he insists on the direct observation of nature that Locke and Hume convert into the modern theory of empiricism, relentlessly seeks the comfort of human life to such an extreme that leads Bentham much later to identify the useful with the good.”

_**“In the eye of human understanding the universe is set like a labyrinth”**_

**Aphorisms I-XVII - Men and science and the futility of science and logic**

Man just works and understands by what he discovers through experimentation, he requires physical and mental (methods) tools.

The science of today (Bacon’s) does not help us improve industry, logic (Aristotle’s) is not good to help us improve science. Syllogism depends on initial notions and when those are wrong they only bring more damage.

It is insane to think that things not yet achieved can be achieved with current methods.

**Aphorisms XVIII- XXXVII. Dogmatism vs Empiricism**

_“There are and can exist but two ways of investigating and discovering truth. The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.”_

_“**Axioms determined upon in argument can never assist in the discovery of new effects;** for the subtlety of nature is vastly superior to that of argument.”_

_“Anticipations (dogmatism) are sufficiently powerful in producing unanimity, for if men were all to become even uniformly mad, they might agree tolerably well with each other.”_

_“The ancient authors and all others are left in undisputed possession of their honors; for we enter into no comparison of capacity or talent, but of method, and assume the part of a guide rather than of a critic."_

**Aphorisms XXXVIII- LXVIII. New science and Idols (errors)**

Illusions and false notions will disrupt the access of truth, unless men arm themselves against them.

**Idols of the tribe**

Illusions founded in human nature, human understanding merges its own nature with the nature of things and distorts them. Human perception is not objective.

The greatest problem with human understanding comes from the weakness of the senses. Human understanding is carried away to abstractions.

_“The human mind resembles those uneven mirrors which impart their own properties to different objects, from which rays are emitted and distort and disfigure them”_

Final causes exists more in our mind than in reality and this has corrupted philosophy

**Materialism**: _“It is best to consider matter, its conformation, and the changes of that conformation, its own action and the law of this action or motion; for forms are a mere fiction of the human mind_”. Marx will later call Bacon the first materialist.

**Idols of the cave**

Illusions of the individual man, due to his particular nature.

They come from people liking certain things more than others, over analyzing similarity and dissimilarity (sharpshooter fallacy) and admiring too much older times (authority principle)

**We should check our biases:** _“In general, he who contemplates nature should suspect whatever particularly takes and fixes his understanding, and should use so much more caution to preserve it equable and unprejudiced.”_

**Idols of the marketplace**

They can be the use of definitions that don't exists, like fortune, first mover, etc… or wrong definitions

**Idols of the theater**

Illusions produced by philosophers who create false and fictitious worlds. There are 3 classes:

* **Sophist** or **dogmatic**: They don't verify their principles
* **Empirical**: When with very few facts an entire philosophy is deduced. Like Aristotels
* **Superstition**: They base their solutions in spirits and magic. Like Plato and Parmenides.

**Aphorisms LIX- XCII**

Experience is the best demonstration of all. But current methods of experiment are poor; men do not take experience seriously enough. Even if they do manage to construct some science on their experiments, they are too keen to rush to a practical application, and so miss the greatest prize. We need to find true axioms from good experiments, which will then benefit practice.

_“The real order of experience begins by setting up a light, and then shows the road by it, **commencing with a regulated and digested, not a misplaced and vague course of experiment, and thence deducing axioms, and from those axioms new experiments**_

**Repetition of knowledge**

_“But if any one turn from the manufactories to libraries, and be inclined to admire the immense variety of books offered to our view, let him but examine and diligently inspect the matter and contents of these books, and his astonishment will certainly change its object: for when he finds no end of repetitions, and how much men do and speak the same thing over again, he will pass from admiration of this variety to astonishment at **the poverty and scarcity of matter, which has hitherto possessed and filled men’s minds**.”_

**Science vs superstition**

_“Nor should we neglect to observe that natural philosophy has, in every age, met with a troublesome and difficult opponent: I mean superstition, and a blind and immoderate zeal for religion. For we see that, among the Greeks, those who first disclosed the natural causes of thunder and storms to the yet untrained ears of man were condemned as guilty of impiety toward the gods. Nor did some of the old fathers of Christianity treat those much better who showed by the most positive proofs (such as no one now disputes) that the earth is spherical, and thence asserted that there were antipodes”_

**Advancement of Science**

_The advancement of science is the work of a powerful genius, the prize and reward belong to the vulgar or to princes, who (with a few exceptions) are scarcely moderately well informed. Nay, such progress is not only deprived of the rewards and beneficence of individuals, but even of popular praise; for it is above the reach of the generality, and easily overwhelmed and extinguished by the winds of common opinions. It is not wonderful, therefore, that little success has attended that which has been little honored_

**Aphorisms XCIII- CXX**

**The merge of empiricism and rationalism**

_“Those who have treated the sciences have been either **empirics** or dogmatical.The former **like ants only heap up and use their store, the latter like spiders spin out their own webs.**_

_**The bee, a mean between both, extracts matter from the flowers of the garden and the field, but works and fashions it by its own efforts.**_ _**The true labor of philosophy resembles hers**, for it neither relies entirely or principally on the powers of the mind, nor yet lays up in the memory the matter afforded by the experiments of natural history and mechanics in its raw state, but changes and works it in the understanding. We have good reason, therefore, to derive hope from a closer and purer alliance of these faculties (the experimental and rational) than has yet been attempted.”_

We need to experiment and increase our technical knowledge and this will lead to great discoveries

_“Our hope of further progress in the sciences will only be well founded, when numerous experiments shall be received and collected into natural history, which, thought of no use in themselves, assist materially in the discovery of causes and axioms”_

Nature hides a lot of its secrets like it did with magnetism and the compass, things we can't even fathom right now

_“We may, therefore, well hope that **many excellent and useful matters are yet treasured up in the bosom of nature, bearing no relation or analogy to our actual discoveries,** but out of the common track of our imagination, and still undiscovered, and which will doubtless be brought to light in the course and lapse of years, as the others have been before them; but in the way we now point out, they may rapidly and at once be both represented and anticipated.”_

On the 4 causes

* **Final**: It corrupts unless it's applied to the actions of men.
* **Form**: Forms are the essential definitions of nature. They are the key to understanding a given nature, not the complicated Aristotelian system.
* **Efficient and material**: They are superficial and unrelated to actual science.

Bacon divides philosophy in 2:

* **Physics** →Inquiry of efficient and material causes → Mechanics
* **Metaphysics** → Inquiry of eternal forms → Magic

**Investigating forms**

To investigate forms, one must begin by presenting to the intellect all the known instances that meet in the same nature. Bacon now explains the procedure for discovering the form of a simple nature.

**1.**_**Table of Essence and Presence**_**:**

The example he chooses is heat. Firstly, all the instances, or examples of the presence of heat are arranged in a table; Bacon cites twenty- eight instances, including "the sun," "flaming meteors," "heated liquids" and "horse shit." They are essentially things or bodies, or even situations that display the nature in question.

**2.**_**Table of Absence in Proximity**_: instances devoid of a particular nature. It is necessary to attach negatives to our affirmatives.

The next stage is to consider divergences, or in this case instances of the lack of heat. Obviously, there are millions of instances in which heat is not present, so Bacon narrows down the field by giving counterexamples to the ones he has already recorded. Therefore the second table consists of instances such as heavenly bodies that do not give out heat, "horse shit" that is not warm to the touch, etc.

**3. **_**Table of degrees**_**:** Comparing increase and decrease in the same subject.

Bacon's third table consists of instances where the given nature varies, or is sometimes present and sometimes not.

For example, the observation that both a fire and boiling water are instances of heat allows us to exclude light as the true form of heat

_**4. Induction**_**:** After the presentation has been made, induction must take place.

Assembling the tables is a methodical and careful way of ensuring that all the evidence is available; ultimately, these tables will be drawn from the comprehensive natural history that Bacon proposes. Another point is important; the preparation of tables to present evidence to the intellect differs greatly from the method of the syllogism, which assumes certain universal truths, such as the form of heat. Bacon's method begins with only experience, and attempts to build such axioms from scratch.

_**5. Exclusion, The First Vintage**_

After some instances of the nature in question have been excluded, a first harvest, or preliminary definition can be attempted. This is a very rough interpretation of the data presented, which Bacon nevertheless believes can be valuable. Its value lies in revealing errors; if the first interpretation is hopelessly inaccurate, the intellect can build upon it.

**Privileged instances**

Privileged instances represent the next stage in Bacon's inductive method. After tables of presentation have been drawn up, and the first harvest or interpretation made, the picture that the investigator has is still blurred. He may have some idea as to what he is looking for, but no firm proof, they help to clarify the situation.

Privileged instances are examples of the nature in question that reveal that nature in a particularly clear way and can assist the senses to draw the correct conclusions, or suggest the correct experimental practice to follow.

There are many forms of privileged instance:

* **Solitary instances**: subjects with nothing in common with other subjects but that nature;
* **Instances of transition**: Nature previously did not exist, and is in transition to non-being.
* **Revealing instances**. These reveal nature naked and independent.
* **Concealing instances**: almost the opposite of revealing instances.
* **Constitutive instances:** A nature under investigation as a lesser Form.
* **Instances of resemblance**. Resemblances between things in the actual object.
* **Unique instances**. Have little connection with other things of the same kind
* **Deviant instances**. Errors and freaks of nature, where nature diverts from its course.
* **Borderline instances**: Compounded of two species.
* **Instances of power**. These are the finished works of any art. A
* **Instances of association and aversion**.
* **Accessory instances**. These mark how far nature can do something.
* **Instances of alliance or union**. These unite natures thought to be separate.
* **Crucial instances**: Reveal that one of the possible natures is permanent, and the other fitful and temporary. The latter can therefore be discarded
* **Instances of divergence**. These are separations of nature that most commonly occur.
* **Instances that open doors**. These assist direct actions of sense, either to see what has not been seen, or to see further, or to see more accurately and distinctly. Like the microscope or telescope.
* **Summoning instances**: These summon things to present themselves that have not previously done so. They make sensible the non-sensible.
* **Instances of the road: I**ndicate discretely continuous motions in nature.
* **Instances of supplement**: Supply information when the senses have drawn a total blank.
* **Cleaving instances**. They cleave nature apart, reminding the intellect of the subtlety of nature. For example, a little drop of ink can make a certain number of letters or lines
* **Instances of the rod:**Things work at fixed and definite distances
* **Running instances**: They measure nature by moments of time.
* **Instances of quantity**: What quantity of a body results in a certain amount of power.
* **Instances of struggle**: Alternating dominance and submission of powers, and point to which one is stronger and prevails, and which one is weaker and concedes.
* **Suggestive instances**. These are instances that point to human benefits.
* **Multipurpose instances**. These are relevant to many topics
* **Magical instance**s. Instances in which the matter or efficient cause is slight in comparison with the result. They are something like a miracle, and Nature supplies them sparingly. Like fire or gunpowder

The use of the privileged instances tends towards either information or operation. In the informative aspect they assist either the understanding or the senses. Privileged instances designate, facilitate or measure practice. Some of the instances should be sought immediately; others only when a table of presentation has been drawn up.

After a storm a group of explorers discover they are on the mystical island of Bensalem, a Christian place where everyone is friendly, charitable, and peaceful.

The inhabitants of Bensalem are described as having a high moral character and honesty, no official accepting any payment from individuals, and the people being described as chaste and pious, brothels are forbidden because marriage is the natural state.

**A group of scientists rules the island from an institution called Solomon’s House**. God appointed these scientists, and so no one questions their leadership. No one is allowed to leave the island, because the scientists don’t want other nations discovering their secrets.

The scientists explain that science and religion are inextricably linked. God designed the world for us to enjoy and discover. He wants us to explore nature, observe it, and learn from it. Once we understand how the natural world works, we can unravel the secrets of the universe.

All knowledge should be used to benefit people and make their lives easier. This is what God intended—He did not intend us to waste knowledge on materialism and warmongering.

A lot of scientific discoveries had been made like submarines and telescopes.
