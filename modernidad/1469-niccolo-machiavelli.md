(1469 - 1527) was a Florentine diplomat, philosopher, politician, historian and writer who lived during the Renaissance. He has often been called the father of modern political philosophy and political science.

For many years he served as a senior official in the Florentine Republic with responsibilities in diplomatic and military affairs. He worked as secretary to the Second Chancery of the Republic of Florence from 1498 to 1512, when the Medici were out of power.

The term Machiavellian often connotes political deceit, deviousness, and realpolitik.

### Art of War <a href="#_n69zt0kkruek" id="_n69zt0kkruek"></a>

_**“To love peace and know how to make war”**_

In the dialog Fabrizio (who could be the interlocutor for Machiavelli) is enamored with the Roman Legions of the early to mid Roman Republic and strongly advocates adapting them to the contemporary situation of Renaissance Florence.

In these dialogues Fabrizio details how an army should be raised, trained, organized, deployed and employed..

If men make the art of war their career they eventually end up corrupted, as Julius Cesar

_“That a good man could not exercise this career as his art; the other, that a well-ordered republic or kingdom never allowed its subjects or its citizens to use it as an art.”_

It should be something that is done and after relinquished, these generals should not even be paid so they do not become reliant on this and despots after the war is finished.

_“So **a well-ordered city ought to want this study of war to be used in times of peace for training and in times of war for necessity and for glory**, and the public alone left to use it as an art, as Rome did.And any citizen who has another end in such a practice is not good; and any city governed otherwise is not well ordered.”_

For Machiavelli, cavalry is a secondary force, **the principal strength of an army is the infantry.** Cavalry is useful in certain scenarios but a well prepared infantry (with pikes) and proper ground (not a field) will always win.

Flags, drums and trumpets are not ornaments, they are used to order the army and to set up tactics.

_“For every science has its generalities upon which it is in good part founded. Of one thing alone I remind you: **never order an army so that whoever fights ahead cannot be assisted by those posted behind.** For whoever makes this error renders the greatest part of his army useless, and he cannot win if he encounters any virtue.”_

In order to maintain order and discipline armies have used oaths and religion, the first promises punishment in this life and the latter in the afterlife in case of a betrayal. Although religion has become a less powerful motivator with the loss of superstition
